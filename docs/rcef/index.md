# Rice Competitiveness Enhancement Fund (RCEF)

## What is the status of RCEF program implementation?

- For the Mechanization component, delays in PHilMech disbursement of funds and lockdowns derailed the schedule of machinery delivery.
- For the Seed component, budget obligation improved from 91% (2019) to 100% (2021). Similarly, the funds disbursed relative to the obligations rose from 86% (2019) to 95% (2021).
 - As of August 2022, the Seed Component disbursed a total of PhP 962 million worth of seeds (60% of the total obligated budget of PhP 1.6 billion). This corresponds to the 1.7 million bags that were distributed for 687,000 farmers tilling a total of 775,000 hectares.

- For the Credit component, the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) released only PhP 145 million (31.6%) out of PhP 459 million obligated for farmers’ credit, while the LandBank of the Philippines (LBP) was only able to obligate only 8% of their total appropriations – equivalent to PhP 44 million – as of May 31, 2022.
  - Low fund obligation and disbursement by LBP is normal as the release of loan proceeds need to coincide with the cropping season. The same situation in the DBP, on the other hand, is due to the staggered fund release based on the actual percentage completion of financed projects.

- Due to the pandemic and its subsequent lockdowns, the Extension Component has had to embrace virtual training seminars and workshops. 
  - From 2020, there were 2,007 training events conducted out of the targeted 2,521 (or 80%) with 23,261 participants trained.
  - In 2021, training events conducted reached 1,739 (87% of the target 1,990) with 58,725 participants.
  - For the 1st semester of 2022, the Component was able to conduct 5,177 training events for the benefit of 130,682 participants.


## What are the key findings from the rapid assessment made on RCEF?

- There were improvements under the Seed component, such as:
  - An increase in RCEF seed utilization for both dry and wet seasons (85% in 2020 DS to 96% in 2022 DS; and 94% in 2020 WS to 97% in 2021 WS); 
  - An increase in yield during DS (3.63 MT/ha in 2019 DS to 4.20 MT/ha in 2022 DS) and WS (3.69 MT/ha in 2019 WS to 4.03 MT/ha in 2021 WS); and
  - An incremental gross revenue of PhP 8,550/ha during DS and PhP 5,000/ha for WS (at PhP 15/kg of fresh palay).
- The Extension component achieved good results as well, such as an increase in the participation of women, and younger average age of farmer participants.


## What are the strategies to ensure that the interventions under the RCEF Program and the National Rice Program (NRP) do not overlap?

- The RCEF and the NRP have delineated the provinces that each will cover. 
  - From 57 provinces, the RCEF Seed Component now implements its intervention (i.e., distribution of certified inbred seeds) to 42 provinces. The NRP, meanwhile, is focused on distributing high-quality seeds to 15 hybrid provinces and 24 non-RCEF provinces.
  - The other components still operate within the 57 provinces.
- Regional Field Offices also regularly coordinate with LGUs to ensure that there is no duplication of beneficiaries.
- Synchronization of the farmers and fisherfolk registry system across DA operating units is being finalized.
- Under RCEF Seed Component, the RCEF Seed Monitoring System developed and maintained by PhilRice is being harmonized with the Farmers and Fisherfolk Registry System of the DA.
Currently, cross-matching of databases is underway, with initial runs yielding partial matches. Full matching is expected to be completed by 2023 DS to 2023 WS.
