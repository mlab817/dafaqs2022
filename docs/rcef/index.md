# Rice Competitiveness Enhancement Fund

## What is the status of RCEF program implementation?

- For the Mechanization component, delays in PHilMech disbursement of funds and lockdowns derailed the schedule of machinery delivery.
- For the Seed component, budget obligation improved from 91% (2019) to 100% (2021). Similarly, the funds distributed relative to the obligations rose from 86% (2019) to 95% (2021).
- As of July 2022, obligation and disbursement rates are at 58% and 73%, respectively. This is due to wet season rice planting will start at the 3rd quarter.
- For the Credit component, the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP) was able to release only PhP 145 million (31.71%) out of PhP 459 million obligated for farmersâ€™ credit and the LandBank of the Philippines (LBP) was only able to obligate only 8% of their total appropriations, equivalent to PhP 44 million, as of 31 May 2022.
- Low fund obligation and disbursement by LBP is normal as release of loan proceeds need to coincide with the cropping season. The same situation in the DBP is due to the staggered fund release based on the actual completion percentage of financed projects.
- Due to the pandemic and its subsequent lockdowns, the Extension component has to embrace virtual training seminars and workshops.

## What are the key findings from the rapid assessment made on RCEF?

- The RCEF Operating Units conducted an internal assessment of the program.
- The Seed component has seen the following improvements:
  - Increase in seed utilization;
  - Increase in yield per hectare; and
  - Increase in gross revenue.
- The Extension component achieved good results as well, such as an increase in participation of women and younger average age for farmers.

## What are the strategies to ensure there is no duplication of beneficiaries of the RCEF Program getting the same interventions from the National Rice Program (NRP)?

- Improved coordination with LGUs was made to ensure fewer redundancies.
- Synchronization of the farmers and fisherfolks registry system amongst DA operating units is being finalized.
