# National Fisheries Research and Development Institute (NFRDI)

## What are the programs of NFRDI to support aquaculture expansion and improve fish sufficiency levels in the country?

- The Philippines is currently 96%[^1] fish sufficient. Sixty percent (60%) of production comes from capture fishing, while the remaining 40% is from aquaculture.  
- Considering the vast opportunity for aquaculture, especially through the optimization of mariculture areas, the NFRDI has intensified its R4D efforts through the Mariculture Research Innovation for Development Program (MARIDEP). 
- It encompasses the entire aquaculture value chain such as environmental monitoring, natural food production, hatchery, broodstock development, grow-out, and marketing and commercialization.
For FY 2023, a total of Php 21.87 million has been proposed for this Program.

## What is the National Stock Assessment Program (NSAP)?

- To know the state of the countryâ€™s fisheries, the National Stock Assessment Program (NSAP) is being conducted to assess major pelagic (fish that inhabits the upper layer of the open sea) and demersal (fish that inhabits the bottom layer of the open sea) species in major fishing grounds of the county through establishment of standardized time series and biological data by fishing ground.
  - Through stock assessment, a Reference Point (RP) can be established to serve as benchmark values based on indicators such as fishery stock size. RPs may also serve as basis for Harvest Control Rules in ensuring a sustainable supply of fish.
  - In 2021, NFRDI, through the NSAP, generated 47 policy recommendations covering 42 species that exhibited signs of being overfished in 11 Fishery Management Areas (FMAs) of the country.
- For FY 2023, NFRDI allotted PhP 138 million for NSAP. Under Tier II, Boat and Gear Inventory (BGI) is being proposed to support information collection for the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) estimation. 
  - The allotted regular budget for NSAP also needs to be increased to support FMA-based governance and science-based findings on the state of fishing grounds and resources.

## How does the NFRDI support the fisheries export industry especially on issues relating to misidentified species?

- Misidentification of species is one of the reasons for the rejection of exports abroad especially in the EU.	
  - From 2016 to 2017, a total of 834 MT of sardines were rejected by the EU market due to the absence of S. lemuru from the list of traded species under the CODEX Alimentarius Commision. These market rejections by the EU (i.e., border rejections in Germany and Netherlands) correspond to USD 1.07 million of opportunity loss for the country for two (2) consecutive years.
- The NFRDI has the technical expertise in reliably identifying fish and fishery products through genetic identification. These services are being provided upon request of BFAR or other concerned agencies as a form of technical assistance. In 2019, a total of 175 specimens for export were analyzed for species identification by the NFRDI Integrated Research Laboratory. 
- To address mislabelling of fishery products, an appropriate national policy and guidelines on catch documentation and traceability of fish and fishery products should be strengthened and strictly enforced.
