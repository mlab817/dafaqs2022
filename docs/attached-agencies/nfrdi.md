# National Fisheries Research and Development Institute (NFRDI)

## What are the programs of NFRDI to support aquaculture expansion and to improve fish sufficiency levels in the country?

- The Philippines is currently 96% fish sufficient. 60% of production comes from capture fishing, while the remaining 40 %is from aquaculture. It is the goal of the Department of Agriculture to reach 94 % fish sufficiency or better in the coming years.
- Considering the vast opportunity for aquaculture, especially optimization of mariculture areas, the NFRDI has intensified its R4D efforts through Mariculture Research Innovation for Development Program (MARIDEP).
- It encompasses the entire aquaculture value chain such as environmental monitoring, natural food production, hatchery, broodstock development, grow-out and marketing and commercialization.

## What is the National Stock Assessment Program (NSAP)?

- To know the state of the countryâ€™s fisheries, the National Stock Assessment Program (NSAP) is being conducted to assess major pelagic (fish that inhabits in the upper layer of the open sea) and demersal (fish that inhabits in the bottom layer of the open sea) species in major fishing grounds of the county through establishment of standardized time series and biological data by fishing ground, which are fundamentals to science-based fisheries management, formulation of policies, plans and strategies.
- Through stock assessment, Reference Point (RP) can be established.
- In turn, RPs serves as benchmark values based on indicators such as fishery stock size.
- RPs may serve as basis for Harvest Control Rules on ensuring a sustainable supply of fish.

## What are the recently available national/fishery management plans supported and participated by NFRDI?

- National Sardines Management Plan;
- National Management Plan for Blue Swimming Crab;
- Roundscad Fishery Management Plan in Northern Palawan;
- Octopus National Management Plan;
- Benham/Philippine Rise Fishery Management Plan; and
- National Tuna Management Plan.

## How does the NFRDI support the fisheries export industry especially on issues relating to misidentified species?

- Misidentified species is one of the reasons for the rejection of exports abroad especially in the EU.
- The NFRDI has the technical expertise in reliably identifying fish and fishery products through genetic identification provided by the in-house DNA Sequencing laboratory under the FishCodes: DNA Barcoding Program.
