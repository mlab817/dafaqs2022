# Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR)

## What is the status of OplanISDA?

- OplanISDA aims to establish a strong direct link between the producers and the sellers of fish commodities, and to provide additional supply at an affordable price in the NCR and other areas of the country.
- From April 2021 to August 2022, a total volume of 585.85 MT were delivered to the respective cooperatives valued at PhP 61.95 million. 
  - From the total volume, 560.74 MT were from aquaculture and 25.11 MT from captured fisheries.
- However, there are also issues and concerns faced by OplanISDA:
  - At present, only 13 cooperatives are engaged in the project. BFAR hopes to expand the operation of OplanISDA to cover major wet markets in NCR;
  - Sizes of fish commodities vary from the standard, affecting their pricing and marketability;
  - Fish supply is frequently undermined by typhoons and natural disasters; and
  - High operating costs from global fuel price spikes are hampering mobilizations of fish supply.
  - Moving forward BFAR aims to institutionalize KADIWA-OplanIsda and develop partnerships with the Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA) and Metro Manila Mayors.
  - For FY 2023, the budget allocation for OplanISDA is PhP 35 million.

## What is the data on fish importation (status of released import clearances)?

- As of August 3, 2022, DA-BFAR has issued a total of 450 Sanitary and Phytosanitary Import Clearances (SPSICs). 
- The total allocation is 28,812.00 MT, with Halieutic Resources Corporation having the largest allocation at 2,800 MT.
- The total volume issued is 25,974.71 MT, with Halieutic Resources Corporation having the highest volume issued at 2,800.00 MT.
- The total volume arrived is 14,791.75 MT, with Trans-Pacific Journey Fishing Corporation having the highest volume arrived at 1,265.50 MT.

## What is the status of legislated hatcheries?

## What are the initiatives of BFAR in the West Philippine Sea?

- BFAR has programs in Regions I, III, and MIMAROPA regarding West Philippine Sea initiatives. 
- These include: distribution of gear/paraphernalia, permit issuance for commercial fishing vessels, training courses for deputy fish wardens, artificial reef deployment, and distribution of bangus fingerlings, among others, in their respective vicinities. 

[^1]: Note that three (3) facilities cannot be implemented due to site suitability issues. BFAR has been collaborating with the concerned LGUs in looking for a technically feasible site for the hatcheries.
