# Philippine Center for Postharvest Development and Mechanization (PHilMech)

## How is PHilMech addressing climate change and other environmental issues?

- PHilMech’s Research, Development, and Extension (RDE) programs and projects are focused on developing or improving technologies, covering areas such as:
  - Mechanical dryers and climate-resilient storage facilities;
  - Developing technologies on climate-resilient crops such as corn, cassava, and mungbean;
  - Designing energy-efficient/-saving technologies; and
  - Research & Development (R&D) on waste and by-product utilization and biological control of pests and diseases.
- For FY 2023, PHilMech is allocating PhP 72 million for its RDE PAPs.
- Accessibility of efficient and climate-resilient/-technologies for rice is made possible by the PHilMech’s role in providing rice production and post-production technologies through the RTL’s Rice Competitiveness Enhancement Program – Mechanization Component (RCEP Mechanization).

## How is PHilMech implementing its mandated activities under RA 10601 or the Agriculture and Fisheries Mechanization Law? 

- In accordance to its mandate under Section 25 of RA 10601, PHilMech coordinates, plans, and executes the agricultural and fishery mechanization and postharvest research, development, and extension programs and projects of the DA.
- PHilMech builds strategic alliances with national agencies, higher education institutions, LGUs, and machinery manufacturers through its Agricultural and Fisheries Mechanization Research, Development and Extension Network (AFMechRDEN). 
- Part of the Network’s operationalization is the harmonization of RDE efforts on agricultural and fishery mechanization to avoid duplication of research interventions and encourage work and resources’ complementation.

## How is PHilMech implementing its mandated activities under RA 10601 or the Agriculture and Fisheries Mechanization Law? (cont’d)

- In compliance with Section 10, Article III[^1] of the abovementioned law, PHilMech established the Agri-Fisheries Mechanization and Engineering Resource Network (AFMechERN) which consists of several agencies involved in the establishment and maintenance of databases such as on:
  - Government investments on agri-fisheries mechanization;
  - Agro-industrial processing technologies;
  - Agri-fishery machinery and equipment manufacturers, assemblers and distributors; and
  - Results of testing and evaluation of agricultural machineries. 

## How is PHilMech implementing its mandated activities under RA 10601 or the Agriculture and Fisheries Mechanization Law? (cont’d)

- The PHilMech also undertakes programs and researches in support to the following commodities to improve mechanization in segments of their respective value chain:

<u>Rice:</u>
- RCEF Mechanization Program for land preparation, crop establishment and care, harvesting, drying, and milling; and
- Improvement and Integration of Fluidized Bed Dryer to the Two-Stage Grain Drying Strategy of Small-Scale Rice Farmer Cooperatives and Associations (FCAs) for drying.

<u>Corn and cassava:</u>
- Pilot Testing of PHilMech-developed Rolling Corn Mill for milling segment; and
- Modification and Performance Evaluation of Four-Wheel Tractor Mounted Cassava Planter.

<u>High Value Crops:</u>
- Field Testing and Improvement of Coffee Sorting Machine for coffee sorting and grading; and
- Technology Performance Verification and Adaptation of KAMICO Developed System of Attachments to Four-Wheel Tractor for Mechanization of Onion Production System.

<u>Other crops:</u>
- Development of Portable Moisture Meter for Copra; and
- Design and Development of Sugarcane De-Thrasher and Whole Stalk Harvester.

[^1]: The strengthening of the database of PHilMech into a network is the mandate of the agency under the support services component.
