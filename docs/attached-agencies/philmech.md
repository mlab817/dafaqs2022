# Philippine Center for Postharvest Development and Mechanization (PHilMech)

## What are the efforts of PhilMech that will contribute to the socioeconomic agenda of the Marcos, Jr. administration?

- All of PhilMech’s PPAs aim to contribute to increase food production, reduce PH losses, and reduce cost of production, and ultimately, food security.
- These are all consistent with most of the president’s eight-point socio-economic agenda of green and blue economy, R&D and innovation, digital economy, energy security, stronger market and entrepreneurship, reducing transport, logistics, and energy costs, and food security.


## How is PhilMech addressing Climate Change and other environmental issues?

- PhilMech’s Research, Development, and Extension (RDE) programs and projects are focused on developing or improving technologies, e.g., mechanical dryers and climate-resilient storage facilities, developing technologies on climate-resilient crops such as corn, cassava, mungbean, designing energy-efficient/-saving technologies, Research & Development (R&D) on waste and by-product utilization and biological control of pests and diseases.
- Accessibility of efficient and climate-resilient/-technologies for rice is made possible by the PHilMech’s role in providing rice production and post-production technologies through the RTL’s Rice Competitiveness Enhancement Program – Mechanization Component (RCEP Mechanization).

## How is PhilMech implementing its mandated activities under RA 10601 or the Agriculture and Fisheries Mechanization Law?

- In compliance with Section 10, Article III of the abovementioned law, PHilMech established the Agri-Fisheries Mechanization and Engineering Resource Network (AFMechERN) which consists of several agencies involved in the establishment and maintenance of databases such as:
  - Government investments on agri-fisheries mechanization;
  - Agro-industrial processing technologies;
  - Agri-fishery machinery and equipment manufacturers, assemblers and distributors; and
  - Results of testing and evaluation of agricultural machineries.
- In addition, PHilMech assesses the supply chain of various commodities to be able to identify the areas or stages of operations where mechanization is needed.
