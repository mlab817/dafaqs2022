# Philippine Carabao Center (PCC)

## Why is the implementation of the Milk Feeding Program (MFP) good for only 20-50 days instead of the 120 days as provided by the law?

- Due to limited funds allotted per School Division Office (SDO), the SDOs prioritize the feeding of primary targets (e.g., kindergarten learners and Grade 1 to 6 learners who were wasted and severely wasted based on the School-Based Feeding Program [SBFP] report) and adjust the feeding days accordingly. 
- The approved budget of the DepEd for SBFP â€“ Milk Feeding component is not enough to feed all the identified undernourished children from Kinder to Grade 6 for 120 days as stipulated in RA 11037.

## How can the Sagip Saka Act aid in the procurement of milk?

- For the purpose of this Act, the procurement by the national and local government agencies of said agricultural and fishery products shall be exempted from the application of the bidding process prescribed under the relevant government procurement laws. 
  - Provided, that the said agencies shall undergo a negotiated procurement under the applicable guidelines of the Government of the Procurement Policy Board (GPPB).
- As of August 2022, the GPPB has yet to issue guidelines to implement the said Sagip Saka Act provision.

## How does PCC ensure that there is enough locally produced milk if there is an expansion of beneficiaries and feeding days?

- With the help of the Carabao-based Business Improvement Network (CBIN)/ Coconut-Carabao Development Project (CCDP) project, PCC makes sure that the future direction of the milk feeding program includes the expansion of areas to have more assisted cooperatives supply milk in the program.
