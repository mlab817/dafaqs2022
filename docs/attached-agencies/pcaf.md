# Philippine Council for Agriculture and Fisheries (PCAF)

## What is PCAF-iCARE?

- The PCAF-Innovative Consultation on A&F Policy Reforms and Engagement (iCARE) Program engages and ensures broad representation of stakeholders across the commodity value chain, participatory policy making, planning and budgeting, project development, and monitoring and tracking of programs and projects.

## What is Japan 2KR?

- The Japan 2KR, officially known as the Japan Grant Assistance for the Food Security Project for Underprivileged Farmers, is an agricultural commodity assistance program that provides grants on projects to increase food production (i.e., fertilizers, agricultural chemicals, and agricultural machinery and equipment). The Philippines has been a recipient of the 2KR Program from 1977 to 2010.
- The monetized value of commodities under the 2KR is utilized for agricultural and fishery development projects of DA.  The peso proceeds for 1997 to 2003 was shared with NEDA on a 50% - 50% basis. 
  - However, upon the request of the DA, the sharing arrangement became 80% - 20% in favor of DA including all accruing balances from 1997 onwards.
- From the total peso proceeds, PCAF has utilized and allocated PhP7.23 billion for agri-fishery development projects, including the areas damaged by Typhoon Yolanda.  DA has a share of PhP 47.35 million while NEDA’s share is PhP 379.44 million from the outstanding balance of PhP 426.79 million.

## What is the PL480 Program?

- The PL480 is the main legislative vehicle that authorizes U.S. international food assistance.  This was enacted in 1954 in line with the U.S. Policy of using its agricultural productivity to enhance the food security of developing countries and the determination of the importing country’s capacity of improving its food security.
- From 1991 to 2006, the GOP has received from the Program a total amount of USD 310 million.  Commodities that were availed of by the GOP include soybean meal, rice, corn, sorghum, and feed peas. The total peso value of these amounted to PhP 11.52 billion. The last commodity loan from the PL480 Program was in 2006.
- Proceeds generated are utilized to fund projects such as: (1) support for market development projects and (2) support of research programs, projects, activities, equipment, and supplies at the DA-supported research stations and institutes and/or Philippine colleges and universities. 
- From the total peso proceeds, the NAFC, now PCAF, has utilized and allocated PhP 9.95 billion for agriculture development projects in support of the AFMA.
