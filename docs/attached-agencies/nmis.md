# National Meat Inspection Service

## How can NMIS assure the public that meat being sold is safe and has passed through the inspection process?

- Meat that came from accredited sources and passed through the inspection process of NMIS are proven fit for human consumption through the issuance of Meat Inspection Certificate (MIC) and Certificate of Meat Inspection (COMI). Carcasses also bear the marks of inspection. 
- Processed meats that are under the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must also bear a label on their packaging to indicate the source and other mandatory information such as product name, net quantity, ingredients, and safe handling instructions.

## What are the actions being undertaken to stop the selling of “double-dead meat” or “botcha” in public markets?

- The NMIS intensified its campaign against the rampant selling of “botcha” or double-dead meat” through the Task Force Bantay Karne (TFBK).
- In the 1st semester of FY 2022, a total of 1,264 enforcement activities have been carried out, leading to the confiscation of 14,691.24 kilograms of hot meat.
- The enforcement activities were conducted in all major public markets and supermarkets in the Philippines.
- The LGUs also continue implementing this program within their respective jurisdiction as required by law (RA 7160).

## What are the quarantine measures being undertaken by NMIS against poultry and livestock diseases?

- NMIS Central Office and Regional Offices, in collaboration with LGUs, conduct continuous extensive monitoring of markets and other distribution channels to ensure that no meat coming from banned countries are sold.
- The Agency also utilizes the Expert and Prompt Response using Event-based Surveillance (ExPRESS) — a surveillance system patterned after the Event-based Surveillance of the DOH to provide early detection and timely response to threats (rare and new)  in animal health, public health, and food safety. 
  - Majority of the health events captured[^1] by the ExPRESS during the 1st semester of 2022 were found to be related to incidences of zoonotic diseases (e.g., Avian Influenza, rabies, leptospirosis, Schistosomiasis, and Filariasis), as well as swine health- or disease-related events, followed by aquatic diseases (such as paralytic shellfish poisoning).
  - Events that have been verified as posing risk to public health, animal health, or food safety triggers the Response under the System that will lead to the feedbacking and regular dissemination of reliable information among NMIS’ Regional Technical Operation Centers (RTOCs).
- For FY 2023, some of the activities proposed under the NMIS’ Disease Surveillance and Response include:
  - Implementation of ExPRESS – Central Office;
  - Prepositioning of Quick Response Team tools, kits, and supplies for the Central Office and for 17 RTOCs such as cleaners, disinfectants, face masks, and alcohol; and
  - Continuous capacity-building activities related to disease surveillance and response such as Seminars on Animal Disease Emergencies.

## What are the processes or requirements in applying for the construction or accreditation of a new meat establishment?

- The Accreditation and Registration Division (ARD) at the NMIS Central Office prescribes the following for the proper construction and establishment of a new meat facility: 
  - For New Applications:
    - Blueprint of engineering plan, sketch of operational flow, Hygiene and Sanitation Program, HACCP Plan/ HACCP Certification, and Evaluation Report or accomplished Criteria for Accreditation.
  - For Renewal:
    - Sketch of operational flow, GMP (for “AA” establishments)/ HACCP (for “AAA” establishments), Certificate of Accreditation (photocopy), and Meat Establishment Certificate of Accreditation (photocopy).
