# Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority (FPA)

## Can FPA control the prices of fertilizers and pesticides?

- No, FPA does not regulate the prices of fertilizers and pesticides. In 1986, due to the massive trade liberalization efforts of the government, the quantitative restrictions on fertilizer were removed. As a result, the FPA discontinued the issuance of import permits for fertilizer and abandoned its price-setting function.
- The AFMA or RA 7716 allowed duty-free importation of fertilizer enterprises engaged in agriculture. The law also grants tariff exemptions to agricultural enterprises – such as farmers and cooperatives – for imported agricultural inputs pursuant to Executive Orders 133 and 376.
- Similarly, Section 109 (B) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 exempts fertilizer subsidiaries from the 12% Value-Added Tax (VAT). This is why the industry players must apply for VAT Exempt Certificate from FPA.
- To encourage fair market competition, the FPA ensures that the registration of fertilizer and pesticide products complies with timelines set in the Citizen’s Charter for market availability of these products. The agency also monitors fertilizers and pesticides’ prices nationwide and submits weekly monitoring reports to the DA.

## How does FPA address the presence of fake fertilizers in the market?

- The FPA continues to disseminate information to warn the public about the proliferation of fake fertilizers and pesticides in the market and avoid products sold by illegitimate dealers.
- Advisories are posted on social media and on the FPA website alongside the issuance of prescribed label formats per type of packaging and product.
- The FPA also continues to conduct random sample collection and analysis of fertilizer samples, and issue Stop, Sale, Use and Marketing (SUMS) for detected fake products.
- Likewise, FPA, in coordination with law enforcement agencies such as the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) and the Philippine National Police (PNP), conduct surveillance and confiscation of fertilizer products which are from tip-offs by concerned citizens and/or legitimate manufacturers.

## How does FPA address the proliferation of illegitimate online sellers and distribution of illegal fertilizer and pesticide products?

- The FPA is currently coordinating with the DTI and other regulatory agencies to come up with a Joint Order to regulate the online selling of illegal agricultural inputs in different online platforms. Likewise, the Agency has already coordinated with these platforms for them to undergo registration and accreditation, as it assures the public of effective and safe agricultural inputs. 
- FPA also informs the public that patronizing unregistered products would expose them to health and environmental hazards, as well as loss of income. They are also advised to avoid and report sellers of products that are unregistered, smuggled, underweight, expired, and do not conform to standards.
- The FPA seeks cooperation from industry stakeholders including dealers’ associations or cooperatives for this campaign. FPA Field Units also have their respective Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) activities in this regard.
