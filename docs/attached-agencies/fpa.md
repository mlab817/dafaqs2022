# Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority

## Why are fertilizer prices high?

- The recent hike in fertilizer prices was influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ukraine-Russia war, and other global events that limited the country’s access to inorganic fertilizers.
- It should be noted that about 90% of the country’s needs for fertilizers are mostly imported from China, Indonesia, and Malaysia while local production accounts for only 10% of the country’s fertilizer supply.
- Other contributory factors in the price-uptrend are the strengthened global fertilizer demand, increased prices of raw materials particularly natural gas and fuel to make fertilizers, and increased logistical and transport cost.

## How does the FPA address the high cost of fertilizer?

- The FPA currently intensified its role on the implementation of the Balanced Fertilization Strategy (BFS) to lessen dependence of farmers on inorganic fertilizers by introducing compost fertilizer, fortified organic fertilizer, and microbial/bio-rational fertilizers in an expanded fertilizer subsidy program. Moreover, the agency also provides financial assistance for the procurement of fertilizer composting facilities for biodegradable wastes (CFBW) to the LGU beneficiaries through Fortified Organic Fertilizer Development Program (FOFDP).
- FPA has also implemented the Fertilizer Watch System for strengthened monitoring and surveillance of fertilizer stock inventory and local pricing.
- In collaboration with the Fertilizer Association of the Philippines (FIAP) and the Philippine International Trading Corporation (PITC), FPA and DA is currently undertaking government initiatives and negotiations to secure allocations from fertilizer-producing countries in the midst of tight supply and high prices on a government-to-government (G2G ) arrangement.

## Can FPA control the prices of fertilizers and pesticides?

- No. FPA does not regulate the prices of fertilizers and pesticides. In 1986, due to the massive trade liberalization efforts of the government, the quantitative restrictions on fertilizer were removed. As a result, the FPA discontinued the issuance of import permits for fertilizer and abandoned its price-setting function.
- The AFMA or Republic Act No. 7716 allowed duty-free importation of fertilizer enterprises engaged in agriculture. The law also grants tariff exemptions to agricultural enterprises such as farmers and cooperatives for imported agricultural inputs pursuant to Executive Orders 133 and 376.
- Similarly, Section 109 (B) of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 exempts fertilizer subsidiaries from the 12% Value-Added Tax (VAT). This is why the industry players must apply for VAT Exempt Certificate from FPA.
- To encourage fair market competition, the FPA ensures that the registration of fertilizer and pesticide products complies with timelines set in the Citizen’s Charter for market availability of these products. Also, the agency monitors the prices of fertilizers and pesticides nationwide and submits weekly monitoring reports to the DA.

## How does FPA address the presence of fake fertilizers in the market?

- The FPA continues to disseminate information to warn the public about the proliferation of fake fertilizers and pesticides in the market and avoid products sold by illegitimate dealers.
- Advisories are posted on social media and on the FPA website alongside the issuance of prescribed label formats per type of packaging and product.
- The FPA also continues to conduct random sample collection and analysis of fertilizer samples, and issue Stop, Sale, Use and Marketing (SUMS) for detected fake products.
- Likewise, FPA in coordination with law enforcement agencies such as the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) and Philippine National Police (PNP), conduct surveillance and confiscation of fertilizer products which are from tipoffs by concern and/or legitimate manufacturers.

## How does FPA address the proliferation of illegitimate online sellers and distribution of illegal fertilizer and pesticide products?

- The FPA is currently coordinating with the Department of Trade and Industry and other regulatory agencies to come up with a joint order to regulate the online selling of such agricultural inputs in different online platforms. Likewise, the Agency has already coordinated with these platforms for them to undergo registration and accreditation, as it assures the public of effective and safe agricultural inputs.
- FPA also informs the public that patronizing unregistered products would expose them to health and environmental hazards, and loss off income. The public is also advised to avoid and report sellers of products that are unregistered, smuggled, underweight, expired, and do not conform to standards.
- The FPA seeks cooperation from industry stakeholders including dealer’s associations or cooperatives for this campaign. FPA Field Units shall also have their respective Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) activities in this regard.
