## What is the status and interventions for the Bt Cotton Project?

### Status of the project
- The Bt Cotton Project is already on its last phase in the commercialization process which is acquisition of the biosafety permit for propagation, pursuant to the Joint DOST-DA-DENR-DOH-DILG Department Circular (JDC) #1, s. 2016.

### Interventions in the project
- In response to frequent weather disturbances, PAGASA’s forecast is being downloaded monthly for use in PhilFIDA’s website. The planting schedule of cotton has been done based on these forecast reports.
- To encourage farmers to engage in cotton planting, continuous technical assistance to farmers on cotton production- providing emphasis on the Good Agricultural Practices (GAP), and documentation of good cotton harvests are being done.
- To advance the Philippine cotton industry, the Cotton Roadmap is currently being crafted and targeted to be completed within FY 2022. This document will be presented to concerned stakeholders for their commitment and contribution to the industry.

## How many abaca areas have been subjected to the abaca disease eradication program?

- From 2009-2021, the Abaca Disease Eradication Program has subjected a total of 51,206.18 hectares to the abaca disease eradication program.
- However, because of the limited budget for this program, PhilFIDA cannot sustain the follow-up checkups needed for the continuous eradication of the disease.
- Further, the presence of the banana plantations adjacent to the abaca areas aggravate the disease incidence.

## Why are PhilFIDA Facilities producing limited number of abaca planting materials?

- The PhilFIDA Facilities cannot produce the planting materials needed by the farmers due to lack of fund to hire personnel and procure the necessary equipment and materials (e.g., chemicals, agricultural supplies) needed for the production of planting materials.

## Does PhilFIDA give free abaca planting materials to LGU/Farmer’s Groups/Cooperatives?

- The planting materials are given free to LGU/ Farmer’s Groups/ Cooperatives, but they are responsible for hauling the planting materials from the PhilFIDA Facilities (Tissue Culture Laboratories/Seedbanks) to their areas.
