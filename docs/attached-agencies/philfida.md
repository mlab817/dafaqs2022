# Philippine Fiber Industry Development Authority (PhilFIDA)

## What is the status of the Bt Cotton Project?  

- The Bt Cotton Project is already in the last phase of the commercialization process which is the acquisition of the biosafety permit for propagation[^1].
- In response to frequent weather disturbances, PAGASA’s forecast is being downloaded monthly for use in PhilFIDA’s website. The planting schedule of cotton has been laid out based on these forecast reports.
- To encourage farmers to engage in cotton planting, technical assistance are continuously being provided to farmers on cotton production – with particular emphasis on Good Agricultural Practices (GAP). Documentation of good cotton harvests are also being done. 
- To advance the Philippine cotton industry, the Cotton Roadmap is currently being crafted and is targeted to be completed within FY 2022. 

## How many abaca areas have been covered by the abaca disease eradication program? 

- From 2009-2021, the Abaca Disease Eradication Program has covered a total of 51,206.18 hectares. 
- However, because of the limited budget for this program, PhilFIDA cannot sustain the follow-up checkups needed for the continuous eradication of the disease. 
- Further, the presence of the banana plantations adjacent to the abaca areas aggravate the disease incidence. 

## Why are PhilFIDA facilities producing limited number of abaca planting materials?

- The PhilFIDA facilities cannot produce the planting materials needed by the farmers due to lack of funds for hiring of personnel as well as for procurement of the necessary equipment and materials (e.g., chemicals, agricultural supplies) needed for the production of planting materials.
