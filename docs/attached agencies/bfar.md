## What is the status of OplanISDA?

- OplanISDA aims to establish a strong direct link between the producers and the sellers of fish commodities and provide additional supply at an affordable price in the NCR and other areas of the country.
- From April 2021 to August 2022, a total volume of 585.85 metric tons (MT) was delivered to the respective cooperatives with a total value of Php 61.95 Million.
- From the total volume, 560.74 MT was from aquaculture and 25.11 MT from captured fisheries.
- Current issues and concerns faced by OplanISDA:
  - At present, only 13 cooperatives are engaged in the project. DA-BFAR hopes to expand the operation of OplanISDA to cover major wet markets in NCR;
  - Sizes of fish commodities vary from the standard, affecting their pricing and marketability;
  - Fish supply is frequently undermined by typhoons and natural disasters; and
  - High operating costs from global fuel price spikes are hampering mobilizations of fish supply.
- Moving forward DA-BFAR aims to:
  - Institutionalize KADIWA-OplanIsda;
  - Develop partnership with Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA) and Metro Manila Mayors; and
  - Establish “Bagsakan Centers” in NCR.
