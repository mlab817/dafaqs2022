## Why is the implementation of the Milk Feeding Program (MFP) good for only 20-50 days instead of the 120 days as provided by the law?

- Due to limited funds allotted per School Division Office (SDO), the SDOs prioritize the feeding of primary targets (e.g., kindergarten learners and Grade 1 to 6 learners who were wasted and severely wasted based on the School-Based Feeding Program (SBFP) report) and adjust the feeding days accordingly.
- The approved budget of the DepEd for SBFP â€“ Milk Feeding component is not enough to feed all the identified undernourished children from Kinder to Grade 6 for 120 days as stipulated in the RA 11037.

## How can local suppliers/ cooperatives be assured of the contract of the MFP if the mode of procurement is bidding?

- As a partner of this program, PCC helps and assists local suppliers/cooperatives in the preparation of legal documents and requirements needed in the bidding process.
- Consider limited source of bidding as mode of procurement.
- Community participation, as a form of Negotiated Procurement is allowed in order to meet specific social objectives or for project sustainability.
- PCC recommends the expansion of coverage to other regions and the amount required for this type of procurement.

## How can Sagip Saka be used for procurement of milk?

- For the purpose of this Act, the procurement by the national and local government agencies of said agricultural and fishery products shall be exempted from the application of the bidding process prescribed under the relevant government procurement laws.
- Provided, that the said agencies shall undergo a negotiated procurement under the applicable guidelines of the Government of the Procurement Policy Board (GPPB).
- As of August 2022, GPPB has yet to issue guidelines to implement the said Sagip Saka Act provision.

## How does PCC ensure that there is enough locally produced milk if there is an expansion of beneficiaries and feeding days?

- With the help of the Carabao-based Business Improvement Network (CBIN)/ Coconut-Carabao Development Project (CCDP) project, PCC makes sure that the future direction of the milk feeding program includes the expansion of areas to have more assisted cooperatives supply milk in the program.
