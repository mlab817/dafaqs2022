# National Meat Inspection Service

## How can NMIS assure the consumers that the meat is safe and passed through the inspection process?

- Meat that came from accredited sources and passed through the inspection process of NMIS are certified fit for human consumption by meat inspection officers through the Meat Inspection Certificate (MIC) and Certificate of Meat Inspection (COMI). Carcasses also bear the marks of inspection.
- Processed meats, that are under the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Authority (FDA), must also bear a label on their packaging to indicate the source and other mandatory information such as product name, net quantity, ingredients, and safe handling instructions.

## What actions are being undertaken to stop the selling of “double-dead meat” or “bocha” in the public market?

- The NMIS intensified its campaign against the rampant selling of “bocha or double-dead meat” through Task Force Bantay Karne (TFBK).  
- The LGUs are also continue implementing this program within their respective jurisdiction as required by law (RA 7160).

## What are the processes or requirements in the application for construction and accreditation of a new meat establishment (e.g. slaughterhouse, cutting plant, etc.)?

- All matters pertaining to the establishment of a new meat facility are referred to the Accreditation and Registration Division (ARD) at the NMIS Central Office. They provide all the necessary information, requirements, and guidance in the proper construction and establishment of a new meat facility. When requested, the NMIS Central Office as well as regional offices can extend technical assistance to the clients.
- Some of the requirements include the following:

  - For New Applications:
    - Blue Print of Engineering Plan, Sketch of Operational Flow, Hygiene and Sanitation Program, HACCP Plan/ HACCP Certification, and Evaluation Report/Accomplished Criteria for	Accreditation
  - For Renewal:
    - Sketch of Operational Flow, GMP (for	AA)/HACCP (for AAA)	Certificate	of Accreditation	(photocopy), and Meat Establishment Certificate	of Accreditation	(photocopy)

## What quarantine measures are NMIS doing against poultry and livestock diseases?

- NMIS Central Office and Regional Offices, in collaboration with LGUs, conduct continuous extensive monitoring of markets and other distribution channels to ensure that no meat coming from banned countries may be sold.
- Expert and Prompt Response using Event-based Surveillance (ExPRESS) is a surveillance system patterned after the Event-based Surveillance of the DOH to provide early detection and timely response to threats in animal health, public health, and food safety.
- ExPRESS also provides for a better coordination and communication between human and animal health agencies in addressing threats and challenges brought about by diseases that may be emerging (unknown) or re-emerging.
