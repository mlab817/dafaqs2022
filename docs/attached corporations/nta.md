## What are the current issues and challenges confronting the tobacco industry? 

- Campaign against tobacco and smoking at both global and local levels, and implementing tobacco control measures as the country’s commitment to WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC);
- Increasing import liberalization and global competition;

- Ageing farmers and scarcity of labor in tobacco production; and
- Continuous escalating costs of farm inputs.


## What is the status of the tobacco industry after the enactment of RA 10351 (sin tax law)? 

- A 29% decrease was documented in tobacco leaf production (from 65 million kilos in 2012 to 46 million kilos in 2021); 23% reduction in farmers or 13,532 (from 52,610 tobacco farmers in 2012 down to 40,572 in 2021); 26% decline or 8,512 hectares in the area of land planted to (from 36,160 hectares in 2012 to 27,698 hectares in 2021).

- For this purpose, the NTA will be implementing the total Tobacco Contract  Growing System and Block Farming, addressing both volume and quality requirement for domestic manufacturing and for export based on Purchase Commitment to be submitted by companies before the start of each tobacco season.
- Support mechanisms include provision of production assistance/ inputs to tobacco farmers shifting towards topped tobacco production, irrigation facilities and flue-curing barns for Virginia and air-curing sheds for burley and native tobacco, and mechanize tobacco farms to assist ageing farmers.

## What is NTA’s role in the implementation of RA 7171 and RA 8240 as amended by RA 10351? 

- Under Republic Act 7171 and RA 8240 as amended by RA 10351, the local government units producing locally manufactured tobacco have their respective shares from the national collection of tobacco excise tax.

- In November 2021, DBM released PhP24.9 billion (for 2019 production) from the tobacco excise tax.
- NTA implements a system of documentation and reporting of tobacco production and acceptances in the beneficiary LGUs and other information necessary, and certifies the same to the DBM, for purposes of allocating the shares of each LGU.
- NTA has established a mechanism to monitor the utilization and measure the impact of the fund allocation of the beneficiary LGUs per DA-DBM-NTA Joint Memorandum Circular No. 2020-1.
