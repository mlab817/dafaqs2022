## What is the NFA’s present level of buffer stock?

- As of 4 August 2022, the NFA’s rice buffer stock is at 130,114 MT.
- This is short by 169,886 MT vis-a-vis the mandated 300,000 MT rice buffer stock that shall be maintained at any given time.
- This level of inventory is equivalent to 191 days’ supply or a total of six (6) months.
- However, this inventory could only last for a period of four (4) days’ supply when based on the daily consumption requirement (DCR) of 33,586 MT.


## What was NFA’s accomplishment for its palay procurement target for the first semester of CY 2022?

- NFA was able to procure 145,736 MT palay out of the targeted 178,703 MT for January to June 2022, which is equivalent to 82% accomplishment.  
- Though considered remarkable, this is still below the set target due to the following factors such as higher prevailing ex - farm prices offered by private traders, and limited drying capacity.


## What are the strategic measures of NFA to increase its palay procurement in CY 2023?

- NFA is continuously procuring palay and enticing more farmers to deliver their stock to the Agency with the implementation of various strategies, such as the following:
  - Request for the approval by the NFA Council of the provision of Buffer Stocking Incentive (BSI) or the increase in the buying price of palay;
  - Involvement of Local Government Units (LGUs) in support to NFA’s rice subsidy program such as the Palay Assistance for Legislators and Local Government Units (PALLGU);
  - Deployment of mobile procurement in far-flung areas and non - traditional palay sources or deficit areas; and
  - Acquisition / Modernization of post - harvest facilities (PHFs) such as mechanical dryers and rice mills.

## Why is it still necessary for NFA to construct new warehouses and post-harvest facilities?

- Construction of new warehouses is necessary, as out of the 319 NFA-owned warehouses nationwide, almost 61% or 195 units were constructed 40 years ago, and nearing its maximum useful life expectancy;
- Additional warehouse space is also needed due to the Agency’s policy on “One Warehouse, One Cereal / Grain type”, (separate warehouse to serve as a food security hub and another warehouse for the storage of palay stocks in major rice producing / procuring areas);
- Acquisition of Post-Harvest Facilities (PHF) is also needed, as modern rice mills and mechanical dryers are cost-efficient to operate compared to older versions of PHFs; and
- The NFA has programmed the construction and acquisition of the following Warehouses and Post-Harvest Facilities for 2022-24:
  - 2022: 27 Mechanical Dryers;
  - 2023: 10 Warehouses, 4 Rice Mills, and 17 Mechanical Dryers; and
  - 2024: 10 Warehouses, 7 Rice Mills, and 29 Mechanical Dryers.


## What is the latest update on the results of the study on the NFA’s optimal level of buffer stock?

- Some results of the study were already approved and accepted by the NFA Council, such as:
  - Optimal volume at 300,000 MT on the national level at any given time; and,
  - Acquisition, Maintenance and Distribution (AMD) Guidelines on the management of the NFA buffer stocks, specifically the adoption of the “6-3 Policy”[^1] on warehouse storage.

- It should be noted that there are still remaining objectives of the study for review and finalization, which are:
  - Establish pricing mechanism for the formulation of the NFA buying price for palay and NFA selling price for rice; and
  - Identify the NFA properties and facilities to be divested or retained.
  
[^1] The 6-3 Policy refers to the study of NFA regarding the 6 months maximum storage of palay and 3 months critical storage of rice to maintain good quality of stocks.
