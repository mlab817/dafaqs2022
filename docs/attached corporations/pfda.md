# Philippine Fisheries Development Authority

## What are the criteria used in the selection of sites for project implementation of fish ports as well as the procedure in requesting assistance for the establishment of post-harvest facilities?

- Availability of fishery resources/supply in the area and the demand for the proposed facilities. The proposed site should be relatively peaceful, power and water supplies should also be readily available, and presence of good roads and communication network is also an advantage.
- The proponent may also send a formal request regarding the need for facilities. The PFDA will then conduct an assessment in which viable projects shall be programmed for implementation.
- Also, Department Administrative Order No. 17 on the Guidelines for the Establishment, Operation and Maintenance of Fishery Post-Harvest Infrastructure Facility and Machinery is used as reference.


## What is the difference between a Fish Port and a Modern Fish Market?

- A fish port is a place where wholesale fish buying and selling takes place between the fish producers and fish traders. It is usually constructed along the seashore.
- A Modern Fish Market is a facility for wholesale and retail fish trading where fish producer/fish broker supplies fresh fish for the consumers, and can be established in landlock urban areas.

## What type of assistance does the PFDA provide to the fishing industry?

- Technical assistance in the preparation of feasibility studies for identified projects, conduct of detailed engineering studies for projects proposed for implementation and training of local personnel on port operation and management.
- Construction/Establishment of infrastructures and other fishery post- harvest facilities such as fish ports, fish markets, ice plants and cold storage to improve fish marketing and distribution.
- Monitoring, compilation and dissemination of fishery statistics and information necessary in the conduct of business activities.


## What are the reasons for non-utilization of some PFDA-constructed facilities?

- After completion of the project and trainings/seminars on food safety and project management has been conducted for LGU staff, the PFDA then turns the facility over to the LGU for operationalization.
- Some of the projects becomes unutilized since the LGU has limited funds to sustain the continuous operation of the project.
- Likewise, if the project needs repairs, it would take time to replace or undertake the repair activity as it must undergo the procurement/bidding processes as required by RA 9184.
- Furthermore, if there is a change in leadership, the project that was constructed by the previous administration may no longer be the priority of the new one and is usually left behind.


## What are the functions of PFDA to be devolved re: Mandanas Ruling?

- Construction, operation, management and ownership of municipal fish ports (MFPs) are to be devolved to the most capable LGUs (i.e. 1st to 4th class LGUs) and PFDA will only provide technical assistance to these LGUs when requested.
- This will enable the NGAs to focus their financial assistance to the least financially able LGUs (i.e. 5th and 6th class). Jurisdiction over MFPs in municipalities under 4th and 5th class shall be retained under the PFDA's jurisdiction.
- It should be noted that site identification for the construction of fish port and other post-harvest facilities, regardless of district classification, is still under the jurisdiction of PFDA.
