These are for the benefit of 2,704 Small Water Irrigation System Association (SWISAs) and Farmersâ€™ Association (FAs) nationwide with a total of 84,341 members.

## Why are solar-powered pumps expensive? 

- The high cost of solar panels is the primary reason for the high price of solar-powered pumps, accounting for up to 60% of the total cost.
- Solar powered pumps also have a significantly longer life expectancy compared to diesel pumps. Solar panels continue to produce electricity for the pump for even longer than 25 years regardless of whether the pump is submersible or surface type.
- The estimated payback period for a 1 hp solar-powered pump is three to four years.
