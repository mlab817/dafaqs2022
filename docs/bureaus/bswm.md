## What is the status of implementation of the Small Water Irrigation System?

- As of December 2021, a total of 20,507 units of Small Scale Irrigation Projects (SSIPs) were implemented covering a total of 168,290 hectares benefitting 2,704 Small Water Irrigation System Association (SWISAs) and Farmersâ€™ Association (FAs) nationwide with a total of 84,341 members.

## What is the investment cost per Small Scale Irrigation Projects (SSIP) type?

| Type of SSIP | Investment Cost |
|--------------|-----------------|
Small Water Impounding Project (SWIP)  | maximum of PhP 300,000.00/ ha for new construction; PhP200,000.00/ ha for rehabilitation/ improvement.
Diversion Dam (DD)  | maximum of PhP 200,000.00/ ha for new construction; PhP100,000.00/ha for rehabilitation/ improvement.
Small Farm Reservoir (SFR)  | maximum subsidy of PhP100,000.00 per unit and PhP 500,000.00 for aggregate of 5 units for new construction; PhP50,000.00 per unit and PhP250,000 for aggregate of 5 units for rehabilitation.
Shallow Tube Well (STW)  | total cost of project (pump sets and tubewell) ranges from PhP50,000 to PhP150,000.00.
PISOS | total cost of project (pump sets and suction pipes) ranges from PhP50,000 to PhP150,000.00.
Spring Development | maximum of PhP 200,000.00/ ha.
Ram Pump | maximum subsidy of PhP650,000 per system (min. of 3 ha)
Wind Pump | maximum subsidy of PhP550,000 per system (min. of 3 ha).
Solar Pump | for non-rice crops, maximum subsidy of PhP650,000 per system (min. of 3 ha); for rice, maximum subsidy of PhP6,000,000.00 per system (min. of 10 ha).

## Why are solar-powered pumps expensive?

- Accounting for up to 60% of the total cost, the high cost of solar panels is the primary reason for the high price of solar-powered pumps.
- The estimated payback period for a one (1) hp solar-powered pump is three  to four years.
