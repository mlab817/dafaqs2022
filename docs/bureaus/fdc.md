# Food Development Center (FDC)

## What specific assistance can FDC render to our farmers/fisher folks taking into consideration food safety in marketing their fresh produce and processed products?

- FDC conducts product development/product improvement and process development/improvement,  shelf-life studies of packaged food products, and establishment of thermal processes of canned foods  based on the needs of the stakeholders.  These services ensure food safety and prevent food wastage during oversupply.
- During technical consultation, and after due evaluation, FDC recommends ways so the stakeholder could have minimal expenses without compromising the safety of the products.

## Can FDC assist in determining authenticity and/or adulteration of fresh produce and processed products?

- FDC can assist in determining such in order to protect the identity of agri-fishery commodities produced by our farmers and fisherfolks.
- Currently, FDC is establishing its Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics Laboratory (MBBL) for these food security and food safety issues.

## How can FDC extend assistance to the local farmer/FBOs in ensuring food safety in the produce, increase their productivity and profitability?

- Prior to its transfer to the Department of Agriculture (DA), the  Food Development Center (FDC) served small and medium  enterprises (SMEs) in food product and process development and improvement of agricultural produce and test the products  to ensure conformance to local and international food safety and  quality standards and specifications.

## How does the Food Development Center food safety training courses differ from other training providers?

- FDC trainings are designed primarily to provide scientific support to FSRAs and FBOs.
- FDC has its own pool of subject-matter experts who act as resource persons on several food safety related training courses for raw food and processed food products. It also offers specialized training courses on food processing, product testing, and food labelling. Training courses are conceptualized and customized depending on the specific needs of FSRAs and FBOs.
