# Food Development Center (FDC)

## What specific assistance can FDC render to farmers, fisherfolk, and food business operators (FBOs) relative to food safety in marketing their fresh produce and/ or processed products? 

- FDC conducts product development/ product improvement and process development/ improvement, shelf-life studies of packaged food products, and establishes thermal processes of canned foods  based on the needs of the stakeholders.  These services ensure food safety and prevent food wastage during oversupply.
- During technical consultations and after due evaluation, FDC makes recommendations so the stakeholder could have minimal expenses without compromising product safety.
- Prior to its transfer to the DA, the  FDC served small and medium  enterprises (SMEs) in food product and process development, improvement of agricultural produce, and product testing to ensure conformance to local and international food safety and quality standards and specifications. 

## Can the FDC assist in determining authenticity and/ or adulteration of fresh produce and processed products?

- A Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics Laboratory (MBBL) is being established[^1] to address food security and food safety issues such as:
  - Admixture in fresh produce, especially cereals and grains and meat in ground state; 
  - Authenticity of chopped/ cut fishery products like tuna, tanigue and pink salmon; and 
  - Mislabeling in processed products/ improper declaration of ingredients which could pose health risks to consumers like allergic reactions, or, worse, anaphylaxis.

[^1]: The documentary requirements are currently being processed for approval of the Biotechnology Program Office (DA-BPO) who will fund the project.

## How does the FDC food safety training courses differ from other training providers?

- FDC training courses are designed primarily to provide scientific support to Food Safety Regulatory Agencies (FSRAs) and FBOs.
- FDC has its own pool of subject matter experts that serve as resource persons on food safety-related training courses for raw food and processed food products. It also offers specialized courses on food processing, product testing, and food labelling. These courses are conceptualized and customized depending on the specific needs of the FSRAs and FBOs.
