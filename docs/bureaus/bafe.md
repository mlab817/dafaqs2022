# Bureau of Agricultural and Fisheries Engineering (BAFE)

## What is the purpose of the Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering Management Information System (ABEMIS)?

- ABEMIS is an in-house-developed, web-based Management Information System which serves as DA’s database repository of A&F-related information that are essential for effective planning, implementation, monitoring, and operationalization, as well as regulation of mechanization, irrigation, FMR, and other infrastructure projects. 
- It was established to help DA efficiently monitor and evaluate the implementation of all its agricultural and fisheries mechanization and infrastructure projects. 

## What is the purpose of establishing Agricultural and Fishery Machinery and Equipment Service Centers (AFMESCs)?

- The government-initiated AFMESCs can provide integrated and complementary agricultural machinery services for the DA’s mechanization programs and projects. It can also complement the services being provided by the service centers of private suppliers and private service farm service providers. It also aims to:
  - Reduce cost of production;
  - Provide greater access to quality, appropriate, and modern agricultural and fisheries machinery and equipment;
  - Facilitate timely farm operations; and 
  - Produce more trained agricultural and fisheries machinery and equipment operators, technicians/ mechanics, and Agricultural and Biosystems Engineers (ABEs). 

## What are the legal basis for the establishment of AFMESCs? 

- The following are the legal bases for the the proposed establishment of AFMESCs:
  - Section 9 of Republic Act (RA) No. 10601, “Agricultural and Fisheries Mechanization Act of 2013”;
  - Section 6 of DA Administrative Order No. 15, series of 2020, “Promoting and Supporting the Establishment, Operation, Maintenance and Management of Agri-fishery Machinery and Equipment Service Centers”; and 
  - Section 2 of DA Memorandum Order No. 37, series of 2020, “Implementing Guidelines in the Establishment and Operation of Agricultural and Fisheries Mechanization Act of 2013”.

## How are AFMESCs different from private farm service providers?

- Most private farm service providers are only offering rental of agricultural machineries such as tractors, rice transplanters, combine harvesters, dryers, and rice/ corn mill. 
- AFMESCs, on the other hand, in addition to providing rental of A&F machineries and equipment, will also offer the following services:
  - Repair and troubleshooting services;
  - After-sales services; and
  - Training services.

## What is the purpose of the Renewable Energy Program for the Agriculture and Fisheries Sector (REPAFS)?

- REPAFS aims to increase the adoption of quality, appropriate, and safe-to-use renewable energy (RE) systems and technologies for enhanced productivity, environmental protection, and sustainable development for the agri-fisheries sector. 

## What is the participation of the Department of Energy (DoE) in REPAFS?

- BAFE, as the Program Management Office of the Project, shall work together with the DoE as per approved REPAFS and JMC No: JMC 2021-02-001. The DoE, specifically, shall:
  - Provide technical expertise to DA in the development and implementation of REPAFS;
  - For the purpose of availing the incentives under RA 9513, administer the accreditation or registration of: 
    - Manufacturers, fabricators, and suppliers of locally produced renewable energy equipment and components in the agri-fisheries sector;
    - Renewable energy projects in the agri-fisheries sector for own-use and/or non-commercial operations; and 
    - Farmers engaged in plantation of biomass resources; and
  - Provide technical assistance in the application of renewable energy systems and technologies in agriculture, aquaculture, and agro-industrial processes.
