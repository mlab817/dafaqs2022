# Bureau of Agricultural and Fisheries Engineering (BAFE)

## What is the purpose and features of Agricultural And Biosystems Engineering Management Information System (ABEMIS)?

- ABEMIS is an in-house developed, web-based Management Information System which serves as DA’s database repository of A&F related information that are essential for effective planning, implementation, monitoring, operationalization and regulations of mechanization, irrigation, FMR, and other infrastructure projects.
- It was established to help DA efficiently monitor and evaluate the implementation of all its agricultural and fisheries mechanization and infrastructure projects.

## What is the purpose of Agricultural And Fishery Machinery And Equipment Service Centers (AFMESCs) establishment?

- To establish a government-initiated A&F machineries and service centers that can provide an integrated and complementary agricultural machinery services and to complement with the DA mechanization programs and projects and with the services being provided by the service centers of private suppliers and private service farm service providers. It also aims to:
  - Reduce cost of production;
  - Provide greater access to quality, appropriate, and modern agricultural and fisheries machinery and equipment;
  - Facilitate timely farm operations; and
  - Produce more trained agricultural and fisheries machinery and equipment operators, technicians/ mechanics, and Agricultural and Biosystems Engineers (ABEs).
  
## What are the legal basis in the establishment of AFMESCs?

- The following are the legal bases for the the proposed establishment of AFMESCs:
  - Republic Act (RA) No. 10601 “Agricultural and Fisheries Mechanization Act of 2013” Section 9;
  - Administrative Order No. 15 Series of 2020 “Promoting and Supporting the Establishment, Operation, Maintenance and Management of Agri-fishery Machinery and Equipment Service Centers” Section 6; and
  - Memorandum Order No. 37 Series of 2020, “Implementing Guidelines in the Establishment and Operation of Agricultural and Fisheries Mechanization Act of 2013” Section 2.
  
## What is the difference of AFMESCs to private farms service providers?

- Most private farm service providers are only offering rental of agricultural machineries such as tractors, rice transplanters, combine harvesters (rice, corn), dryers (mechanical dryer, flat-bed dryer, multipurpose drying pavement), and rice/ corn mill. The AFMESCs will also offer the following services:
  - Rental of A&F machineries and equipment;
  - Repair and troubleshooting services;
  - After-sales services; and
  - Training services.
  
## What is the purpose of  Renewable Energy Program for the Agriculture and Fisheries Sector (REPAFS)?

- REPAFS aims to increase the adoption of quality, appropriate, and safe to use renewable energy systems and technologies for enhanced productivity, environmental protection, and sustainable development for the agri-fisheries sector.

## What is the participation of the Department of Energy (DoE) in REPAFS?

- The BAFE, as the Program Management Office of the Project shall work together with the  Department of Energy (DOE), as per approved REPAFS and JMC No: JMC 2021-02-001, shall:
  - Provide technical expertise to DA in the development and implementation of REPAFS;
  - For the purpose of availing the incentives under RA 9513, administer the accreditation or registration of:
    - manufacturers, fabricators, and suppliers of locally produced renewable energy equipment and components in the agri-fisheries sector;
    - renewable energy projects in the agri-fisheries sector for own-use and/or non-commercial operations; and
    - farmers engaged in plantation of biomass resources; and
  - Provide technical assistance in the application of RE systems and technologies in agriculture, aquaculture, and agro-industrial processes.
  
## With the implementation of the Garcia-Mandanas Ruling in the LGUs, what are the possible interventions of the LGUs in the implementation of REPAFS?

- Coordination and collaboration with LGUs on their involvement for the implementation of REPAFS and its inclusion with the local development plans.
- A collaboration with DILG for the issuance of Memorandum Circular on the mobilization and support of LGUs.
