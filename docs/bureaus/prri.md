# Philippine Rubber Research Institute

## What is the economic importance of rubber and how can farmers and the government benefit from investing in rubber?

- The Philippines ranked as top eight among the world’s top ten rubber-producing countries and accounts for 1% of the world’s total dry rubber production (The Association of Natural Rubber Producing Countries [ANRPC], 2019). 
- The employment generated in the countryside is composed of 90% smallholder rubber farmers and 10% large-scale farmers (i.e., rubber cooperatives, traders, and processors). 
- Rubber contributes 0.7% of the total crop production in the Philippines amounting to PhP. 3.7 billion (PSA, 2019).
- Further, rubber is a lucrative industry with potential for profitable investment in the new normal, as it serves as raw material in making surgical gloves for medical frontliners, as well as in various products such as automobile tires, gaskets, linings, condoms, rubberized roads, seismic bearings for bridge retrofitting, other sporting materials (i.e., tennis, basketball, etc.), and other industrial rubber-based products (Philippine Rubber Roadmap 2017-2022).

## What is the role of PRRI in improving the Philippine Rubber Industry?

- PRRI is developing clones that are high-yielding and resistant to diseases. The institute is also developing pre/postharvest technologies that will improve productivity of rubber.
  - As of August 2022, four (4) new potential rubber clones have been identified and collected; these are on top of the 29 rubber clones collected internationally since 2015. These clones are now on the replication and on-field trial establishment phase.
- PRRI also provides seminars and training courses to boost the skills and knowledge of various rubber stakeholders in order to increase the productivity of their rubber farms as well as improve their entrepreneurial skills.
- The institute also continuously foster partnerships with Local Government Offices, Non-NGOs (e.g., Philippine Rubber Industry Association [PRIA], and Philippine Rubber Farmers Association [PRFA]), and international agencies (e.g., International Rubber Research and Development Board [IRRDB] and Association of Natural Rubber Producing Countries [ANRPC]) to further advance the country’s rubber industry.

## How does PRRI address the low price of rubber cuplump? 

- In order to increase the price of rubber products, the PRRI promotes value-adding to produce goods such as higher grade of centrifuge latex and rubber sheets which are raw materials for producing condoms, tires (especially for luxury vehicles), and medical gloves. 
  - To facilitate this, PRRI is pushing for the establishment of village-based rubber processing plants[^1] for the processing of cuplumps into rubber crepe pale and rubber sheets. 
  - In turn, this aims to increase the income of rubber farmers by at least 30%.
- Also, PRRI will continue and strengthen its information drive on rubber cuplump value-adding.

[^1]: PRRI has proposed the construction of one (1) rubber processing plant in Zamboanga Sibugay under its FY 2023 Tier 2 (PhP 8.95 million). If disapproved, they will propose this through an external funding agency.
