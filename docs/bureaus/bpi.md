## What are the future plans of BPI to address smuggling of agricultural goods?

- BPI intends to enter into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with concerned agencies to establish a system on filing cases against importers that have been proven to commit violations deliberately so that their License to Operate (LTOs) can be revoked by the BPI;
- Concerned DA Regulatory Agencies will establish close coordination for all interceptions and disposal of smuggled agricultural products conducted by the Bureau of Customs (BOC) since this is part of the agreements under the Customs Memorandum Order No. 4-2007, “Implementation of the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the Department of Finance and Department of Agriculture on Anti-smuggling”; and
- DA Regulatory Agencies to request access as a regular DA-BOC inter-agency operation at domestic shipyards to address those commodities which were reported to illegally enter and are transported to different parts of the country via domestic route;
- DA shall request full authority to confiscate smuggled agricultural products upon confirmation by the concerned DA regulatory agency; and 
- DA shall request the BOC for the inclusion of other food stuff in the inspections being conducted by DA regulatory agencies.
