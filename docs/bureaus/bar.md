# Bureau of Agricultural Research (BAR)

## What is the Department’s level of R4D investment for the past 10 years?

- For the past 10 years, the average R4D investments of the DA has been PhP 2.45 billion – equivalent to about 9% average investment growth for the concerned period. 
- The Department’s research intensity or share vis-a-vis the country’s overall GDP and GVA for the A&F sector only averages to 0.02% and 0.17%, respectively. 
  - This is below the recommendations of both the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act of 1997 (AFMA) which is 1% of the country’s GDP. 
- Overall, DA-BAR’s R4D budget from 2012-2022 has had an average growth rate of about 2%.

## How does BAR ensure that its programs will bring impact to the lives of farmers and fishers?

The DA-BAR created an Inclusive and Transformative R4D Framework to ensure that its strategies and refocused programs are consistently anchored on DA’s thrusts and programs to address the issues and challenges facing the A&F sector. Moreover, the Bureau:
- Employs (a) multistakeholder, collegial, and farmer- and fisher- inclusive R4D agenda setting and prioritization, (b) streamlined call for proposals and guidelines, (c) rigorous proposal screening and project monitoring and evaluation system, and (d) careful and diligent assessment of R4D technologies and outputs from completed projects;
- Laid down the criteria and guidelines to develop technologies that have farm- and industry-level applications; and 
- Established a highly competitive grant system to ensure the sound and effective program coordination and management on the national level and on the level of the project implementing agencies and R4D partners.

## What are BAR’s initiatives to scale up developed A&F technologies?

- There are **harmonization initiatives** with the DA-Agricultural Training Institute (ATI) to establish a link between the conduct of R4D and extension activities to provide clarity and focus on the management of agriculture and fishery technologies;
- **New R4DE programs have been developed**, such as the Yamang Lupa: Scale UP Program and Technology Business Incubation Program:
  - The Yamang Lupa Scale Up Program aims to adapt the science-led soil revival strategies and management practices to increase the farmer’s productivity and strengthen their coping mechanisms amidst climate irregularities. It has been launched in Regions I, IVA, VIII, and IX and targets to benefit 2,000 farmers. For FY 2023, it has a budget allocation of PhP 40 million.
  - The Technology Business Incubation focuses on increasing the capacities of research-based enterprises. It has been been implemented in 11 regions (i.e., CAR, Regions I to IVB, and VI to X) and has so far supported nine (9) incubators. For FY 2023, the budget allocation for the program is PhP 24 million.
- BAR also seeks to **intensify R4DE initiatives on food mobilization and marketing partnerships and linkages** from organizations such as Baurtek Corporation, Mayani Inc., GoNegosyo, and Food and Drug Administration; and
- **Strengthening** of Intellectual Property Policy and Technology Transfer Protocol.
