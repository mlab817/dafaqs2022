# Agricultural Training Institute (ATI)

## What are the programs, projects, and activities of the ATI for the youth?

- **Capacity Building/Capability Enhancement** - technical training courses aimed at improving knowledge, skills, and attitude on various topics related to agriculture, fisheries, and managerial and entrepreneurial skills of the youth;
- **Educational Assistance for the Youth: Degree Courses in Agriculture and Agricultural Biosystems Engineering (EAsY Agri)** - aims to encourage deserving children of smallholder farmers and fishers to pursue studies and a professional career in agriculture and/or venture to agripreneurship;
- **Internship Programs for the Youth** (Young Filipino Farm Leaders Training Program in Japan and Filipino Young Farmers Internship Program in Taiwan) - training programs that provide opportunities for young farmers to learn farming techniques, management skills, and farm youth activities abroad;
- **Binhi ng Pag-asa Program** - a special project through the Office of Senator Grace Poe in collaboration with DA-ATI. The program aims to provide the youth training courses in agriculture leadership and values formation, and expose them to agribusiness opportunities; and
- **e-Extension Program for Agriculture and Fisheries** - these are accessible and free online resources for the youth and includes e-Learning, webinars, and e-Farming.

## What role does the Learning Site for Agriculture (LSA) play in helping improve the agriculture and fishery sector? 

- The establishment of certified LSAs aims to contribute to the improvement in productivity and profitability of the less developed but resource-rich farming/ fishing communities and the non-farming rural community members engaged in agri-processing enterprises.
  - The LSA is a farm owned by a farmer/ farming family that practices different agricultural and fisheries technologies. These LSAs are also model farms that help in the dissemination of different technologies and can, in fact, influence the farming practice in their respective communities.
  - Moreover, LSA operators can be tapped as farm leaders/ managers to act as primary actors in assisting the clustering and consolidation efforts of the DA.
- As of August 2022, a total of 1,597 LSAs were certified since 2016. For FY 2023, ATI is targeting 145 sites to attain LSA certification.

## What is the adoption rate on new technologies among farmers/ fisherfolk trained by the ATI?

- Since 2018, the ATI annually conducts a Results-Based Monitoring and Evaluation (RBME) study covering respondents who received ATI’s interventions three years prior.
- For the FY 2021 study, 1,392 beneficiaries from ATI’s FY 2018 program served as client-respondents (comprised of 1,093 farmers and 299 Agricultural Extension Workers).
  - Results of the study showed that 94% of the client-respondents have adopted agri-fishery technologies. 
  - Some of the technologies adopted are on the following:
    - Backyard gardening/farming;
    - Good Agricultural Practices; 
    - Organic agriculture; 
    - Vegetable farming;  
    - Modern livestock/poultry technologies;  and 
    - Animal waste management.
