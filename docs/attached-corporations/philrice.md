# Philippine Rice Research Institute (PhilRice)

## What is the current status of the Philippine Rice Industry?

- Prevalence of generally favorable conditions provided ample room for palay and milled rice production growth in the country. Total palay production for 2021 is at 19.96 million MT, a bit higher than 2020 production recorded at 19.29 million MT. Average yield per hectare increased from 4.09 mt/ha in 2020 to 4.15 mt/ha for 2021.
- Share of municipalities with yields more than 3 mt/ha increased from 2019-2021.
- At 65.4% milling recovery rate, the 19.96 million MT of palay produced 13.05 million MT of milled rice (bigas).
- Despite sustained increases in the annual production of rice since 2016, domestic rice production is still not enough due to continued increase in local demand. Current self-sufficiency ratio in local rice production stands at 85% in 2020.
- The Rice Tariffication Law (RA 11203) lifted the quantitative restriction on rice imports. This resulted in a total milled rice imports of 2.97 million MT for 2021, that resulted in hefty beginning stocks of 2.38 M tons in 2022.
- Farmgate, wholesale, and retail prices of rice continued to contract. Farmgate prices of palay decreased from PhP 20.40/kg in 2018 to PhP 16.75/kg in 2021. Wholesale prices of milled rice contracted from PhP 38.44/kg in 2018 to PhP 33.62/kg in 2021. Similarly, retail prices of milled rice also decreased from PhP 40.75/kg in 2018 to PhP 37.60/kg in 2021.

## What is the current demand level for rice?

- Rice demand increased from 12.13 million MT in 2016 to 16.03 million MT in 2021. This figure in 2021 is composed of food use (89%), seeds (1%), feeds and waste (5%), industrial use (3%), and change in stocks (1%).
- Increase in total demand is driven by increase in food demand. This is a direct result of population growth which is at 1.35% annual average. The net per capita rice available for food rose from 108 kg/person/year in 2016 to 130 kg/person/year in 2021.

## What is the current cost of palay production?

- The cost of producing palay per hectare soared as price of inputs grew. Production cost rose from PhP 42,708/ha in 2016 to PhP 47,089/ha in 2020.
- With the spiraling prices of fertilizers and fuel in 2022 brought about by the Russia-Ukraine war, production cost is estimated to increase up to almost PhP 56,000/ha.
- While yield climbed up, income from rice production fell from PhP 24,719/ha in 2016 to PhP 21,430/ha in 2020.
