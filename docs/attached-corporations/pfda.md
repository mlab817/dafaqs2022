# Philippine Fisheries Development Authority (PFDA)

## What are the criteria used in the selection of sites for fish port projects and the procedures for requesting assistance on the establishment of postharvest facilities?

- Fundamentally, fish port projects should be situated in areas with fishery resources/supply as well as demand for the proposed facilities. The proposed site should likewise be relatively peaceful, with power and water supplies readily available. The presence of good roads and communication network is also an advantage.
- Proponents may send a formal request regarding the need for fisheries postharvest facilities. The PFDA will then conduct an assessment on the viable projects that can be programmed for implementation.
- The DA Administrative Order No. 17 on the Guidelines for the Establishment, Operation and Maintenance of Fishery Postharvest Infrastructure Facility and Machinery is also used as reference.

## What is the difference between a Fish Port and a Modern Fish Market?

- A fish port is a place where wholesale fish buying and selling takes place between the fish producers and fish traders. It is usually constructed along the seashore.
- A Modern Fish Market is a facility for wholesale and retail fish trading where fish producer/fish broker supplies fresh fish for the consumers. These can be established in landlocked urban areas.

## What type of assistance does the PFDA provide to the fishing industry? 

- **Technical assistance** in the preparation of feasibility studies for identified projects, conduct of detailed engineering studies for projects proposed for implementation, and training courses for local personnel on port operation and management;
- **Construction/ establishment of infrastructures** and other fishery postharvest facilities such as fish ports, fish markets, ice plants, and cold storage to improve fish marketing and distribution; and
- **Monitoring, compilation, and dissemination of fishery statistics** and information necessary in the conduct of business activities.
  
## What are the reasons for non-utilization of some PFDA-constructed facilities? 

After completion of the project and provision of training courses/ seminars to LGU staff on food safety and project management, the PFDA then turns the facility over to the LGU for operationalization. 
- Some of the projects become unutilized when the LGU encounters limitations on funds to sustain the continuous operation of the project. 
- In cases when the project needs repairs, it would also take time to replace or undertake the repair activity as it must undergo the procurement/ bidding processes as required by RA 9184. 
- Further, if there is a change in leadership, the project that was constructed under the previous administration may no longer be the priority of the new one and is usually left behind.
