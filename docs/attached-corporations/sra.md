# Sugar Regulatory Administration (SRA)

## What is the total raw sugar production for crop year 2021-2022? 

- As of July 31, 2022, total raw sugar production reached 1.79 million MT. This is 99% of SRA’s 2021-2022 final crop estimate of 1.80 million MT. 
  - Raw sugar production for CY 2020-2021 was 2,138,147 MT, while refined sugar production for the same crop year was 758,840 MT.
- Lower sugar production this crop year can be attributed to:
  - Reduction in sugarcane areas;
  - Effect of climate change; and
  - High costs of fertilizer and fuel.

## What are the projected production and demand levels in the next crop year? 

- SRA projects that, under normal weather conditions, production of raw sugar in the next crop year may reach above 1.86 million MT.
- Total demand is still projected to be around 2 million MT – this has been the average consumption for the last 5 years.

## What are the prevailing wholesale and retail prices?

- Based on the price monitoring by SRA on August 5, 2022, average sugar prices are as follows:

- There are two (2) sugar mills in Negros Occidental that will operate in August and September 2022; these are expected to help build local supply.
- As the supply of sugar increases, the high price of sugar is also expected to revert to its traditional suggested retail price which is around PhP 50/ kilogram.

## What are SRA’s interventions to improve the production of sugar in the next cropping seasons?

There are ongoing projects under the Sugarcane Industry Development Act (SIDA) which are aimed to improve the productivity and production of sugar. 
Following are some of the accomplishments under major SIDA Programs from 2016 to June/July 2022:
- **Block Farm Program** - The program is the consolidation of small farms including farms of agrarian reform beneficiaries as one larger farm, with a minimum of thirty (30) hectares within a two-kilometer radius to take advantage of the economies of scale in the production of sugarcane. The program has completed 100% of farm mechanization support for block farms funded from 2016 to 2019 GAA with a total of 6,687 farmer beneficiaries;
- **Infrastructure Program** - The program aims to facilitate the transport of sugarcane to mills and distilleries, and enhance the marketing and export of sugar and other products derived from sugarcane. From 2016 to July 2022, a total of PhP 3.839 billion has been released for FMR and bridge projects under SIDA. Correspondingly, a total of 201.93 kilometers of FMRs have been completed, as well as 57 meters of concrete bridges;
- **Socialized Credit Program** - The program offers sugarcane production loan at 2% interest rate per annum to sugarcane farmers (tilling 10 hectares or less) and block farms. From 2016 to 2022, a total of Php 976.222 million of loans were endorsed to the LandBank, of which Php 545.490 million has been approved. To date, Php 597.365 million has been released by the LBP;
- **Scholarship Program** - The program has been focusing on providing scholarships for baccalaureate and post-graduate courses through partnership with CHED and TESDA. From 2016 to June 2022, there have been 1,110 baccalaureate and post-graduate scholars, 455 graduates of SUCs, and 3,846 vocational scholars that graduated through TESDA; and
- **Research, Development, and Extension Program** - Notable projects under this program include the distribution of 34 sugarcane grabber-loader and 55 units of tractor-driven whole stalk sugarcane harvesters, and propagation of high-yielding varieties in 61 nursery sites that would later provide the planting material needs of 23 mill districts.
- These SIDA Programs are envisioned to contribute to the improved incomes of sugarcane farmers.
- Below are the target[^1] average income per hectare of block farm:
  - For CY 2020 to 2021: PhP 67,412.00; and
  - For CY 2021 to 2022: PhP 72,916.17.
- There are ongoing projects under the Sugarcane Industry Development Act (SIDA) which are aimed to improve the productivity and production of sugar. In turn, this will translate to improved income of sugarcane farmers and workers.
- The Production Support Services of SRA has regular and continuing projects available to sugarcane farmers and targets not only to improve their productivity, but also to lower their production cost.
- There are also Research and Development undertakings. As the volume of sugar production is highly affected by weather, the SRA funds research activities to develop sugarcane varieties for both waterlogged and drought conditions.
