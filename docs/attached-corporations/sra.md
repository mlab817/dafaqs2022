## What is the total raw production for the crop year, 2021-2022?

- As of July 31, 2022, the total raw sugar produced is 1.792 million metric tons. This is 99% of the SRA’s 2021-2022 final crop estimate of 1.80 million metric tons.
- The raw sugar production for CY 2020-2021 was 2,138,147 metric tons. On the other hand, refined sugar production for CY 2020-2021 was 758,840 metric tons.
- The lower sugar production this crop year can be attributed to:
  - Reduction in sugarcane areas;
  - Effect of climate change; and
  - High cost fertilizer and fuel.
  
## What is the projected production and demand in the next crop year?

- SRA is optimistic that in normal weather conditions, production of raw sugar in the next crop year may reach above 1.86 million metric tons.
- Total demand is still projected around 2 million metric tons, as it was the average consumption for the last 5 years.

## What are the prevailing wholesale and retail prices? How long do we see these high prices of sugar will last?

- As of August 5, 2022, SRA’s monitored sugar prices are the following:
### Raw sugar
  - wholesale 50KG: Php3,250.00
  - retail supermarket: Php69.50 & retail wet market: Php70.00
### Washed sugar
  - wholesale 50KG: Php3,330.00
  - retail supermarket: Php69.50 & retail wet market: Php75.00
### Refined sugar:
  - wholesale 50KG: Php4,400.00
  - retail supermarket: Php89.50 & retail wet market: Php95.00
- There are 2 sugar mills in Negros Occidental that will operate this August & September 2022, in which it is expected to help build local supply.
- As the supply of sugar increases, the high price of sugar is also expected to revert to its traditional suggested retail price which is around P50/kilogram.


## What are the actions made by SRA to address the high price and low supply of sugar in the market?

- To mitigate the effects of low sugar supply in the domestic market, the government has authorized the first import program for CY 2021-2022 or the importation of 200,000 metric tons of refined sugar for industrial users.
- The SRA issued Sugar Order No. 3, Series of 2022 for the guidelines of this importation program.
- The implementation of this SO is on-going and as of August 8, 2022, a total of 170,659 metric tons of imported sugar has already arrived in the country.


## What are the government’s (SRA) interventions to improve production of sugar in the next cropping seasons?

- The Sugarcane Industry Development Act (SIDA)- projects funded by SIDA are ongoing which are aimed to improve the productivity and production of sugar. In turn, this will translate to improved income of sugarcane farmers and workers.
- The Production Support Services of SRA has regular and continuing projects available to sugarcane farmers and targets not only to improve their productivity, but also to lower their production cost.
- There are also Research and Development undertakings. As the volume of sugar production is highly affected by weather, the SRA funds research activities to develop sugarcane varieties for both waterlogged and drought conditions.
