# National Tobacco Administration (NTA)

## What is the significance of the Philippine Tobacco Industry?

- The local tobacco industry is one of the major pillars of the Philippine economy in that it provides income and sustenance to about 2.1 million Filipinos engaged in production, trading, processing, and marketing of tobacco and tobacco products.
- It has also contributed revenue amounting to PhP 149.7 billion in 2021 (manufactured and unmanufactured) due to RA 10351 (Sin Tax Reform Law) as amended by RA 11346, which helps the government fund its health and social welfare programs, delivery of services, economic, infrastructure, education. 
- Exports of 32.32 thousand MT of tobacco in 2020 was valued at PhP 6.74 billion, accounting for  2.1% in the total value of agricultural exports.
- Part of the excise taxes from locally manufactured tobacco products accrues to the tobacco producing provinces via RA 7171 and 8240, amounting to PhP 24.9 billion in 2019, which the LGUs can use for their priority programs and projects.

## What are the current issues and challenges confronting the tobacco industry?

- Campaign against tobacco and smoking at both global and local levels, and implementing tobacco control measures as the country’s commitment to WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC);
- Increasing import liberalization and global competition;
- Increasing illicit trade brought about by increasing excise taxes;
- Implementation of laws that help the government increase taxes may cause the proliferation of illicit tobacco products and reduce the demand for legitimate items due to high cost of taxes paid by manufacturers;
- Ageing farmers and scarcity of labor in tobacco production; and
- Continuous escalating costs of farm inputs.

## What is the status of the tobacco industry after the enactment of RA 10351 (Sin Tax Reform Law)? 

A 29% decrease was documented in tobacco leaf production (from 65 million kilos in 2012 to 46 million kilos in 2021); 23% reduction in farmers or 12,038 (from 52,610 tobacco farmers in 2012 down to 40,572 in 2021); and 23% decline in areas or 8,462 hectares of land planted to tobacco (from 36,160 hectares in 2012 to 27,698 hectares in 2021).
- In support of the tobacco farmers, the NTA shall concentrate on the production of leaf tobacco for export and for substitution of the blending tobacco being imported for domestic manufacturing.
- For this purpose, the NTA will be implementing the Tobacco Contract  Growing System and Block Farming, addressing both volume and quality requirement for domestic manufacturing and for export based on the Purchase Commitment to be submitted by companies before the start of each tobacco season. A total of PhP 100 million was proposed for this program under FY 2023.
- Support mechanisms include provision of production assistance/ inputs to tobacco farmers shifting towards topped tobacco production, irrigation facilities and flue-curing barns for Virginia, and air-curing sheds for burley and native tobacco.

## What is NTA’s role in the implementation of RA 7171 and RA 8240 as amended by RA 10351?

- Under RA 7171 and RA 8240 as amended by RA 10351, LGUs producing locally manufactured tobacco shall have their respective shares from the national collection of tobacco excise tax.
- The beneficiary LGUs shall use the fund to implement programs or projects that directly benefit tobacco farmers and their communities and other projects per guidelines issued by the DBM.
- In November 2021, DBM released PhP 24.9 billion from the tobacco excise tax (for 2019 production).
- NTA established a system of documentation and reporting of tobacco production and acceptances in the beneficiary LGUs and other necessary information, and certifies the same to the DBM for purposes of allocating the shares of each LGU.
- NTA has also put in place a mechanism to monitor the utilization and to measure the impact of the fund allocation of the beneficiary LGUs per DA-DBM-NTA Joint Memorandum Circular No. 2020-1[^1].

## What is the Tobacco Fund’s (RA 4155) specific purpose and current status?

- Per RA 4155, or An Act to Promote and Strengthen the Virginia Tobacco Industry, the Tobacco Fund shall be used for operational, office and field expenses, and establishment of a Research and Grading Institute.
- About Php 5.5 billion has been released from the Tobacco Fund from 2010-2022 for the implementation of various programs and projects, such as tobacco farmers production assistance or the provision of inputs, fertilizers, cash for tobacco production, irrigation support projects, and curing barn assistance, among others.
  - The amount released so far is only 5.7% of the net balance of PhP 93.3 billion from the Tobacco Fund as of May 2022 (this is equivalent to an average of only about PhP 500 million released annually to NTA).
- NTA has proposed to utilize PhP 26.8 billion from the Fund to meet the budgetary requirement for the Sustainable Tobacco Enhancement Program (STEP) (2021-2025), a five-year development roadmap for the tobacco industry. 
- Some of the activities proposed under STEP include:
  - Technology Assistance, Extension and Production Services (which includes Tobacco Contract Growing System and other Block Farm components) – PhP 26.2 billion;
  - Industrial Research (including the establishment of Tobacco Grading Institute) – PhP 228.7 million;
  - Agricultural Research – PhP 50.7 million; and
  - Regulatory Services – PhP 181.8 million.
