## What is the National Irrigation Master Plan 2020 – 2030?

- The NIMP 2020–2030 will serve as a national reference guide of irrigation agencies and stakeholders.
- The 10-year master plan aims to achieve food security and poverty reduction with accelerated and sustained irrigation development under diversified crop production systems. 
- A total of 681,709 hectares of new irrigated areas are targeted to be generated within 2020-2030 according to the Plan.
- Under the NIMP, the estimated investment requirement for 2020-2030 amounting to PhP 561 billion will be distributed as follows:
  - NIA: PhP 337 billion;
  - LGU: PhP 195 billion; and
  - OGA: PhP 29 billion
- What is the status of project implementation of irrigation programs for the past 2 years?
- As of July 2022, the physical performances of the FY 2021 and 2022 programs are at 84.23% and 32.58%, respectively (refer to the table below). These were affected mainly by the enhanced community quarantine imposed during the pandemic.

## What are the updates on the Free Irrigation Service Act (FISA)?

- FISA serves as subsidy incentive for Irrigators’ Associations (IAs) for taking over Operation and Maintenance management responsibilities. The amount of incentives vary, as follows:
  - For operations incentive: PhP 150 per hectare per cropping of validated area planted.
  - For maintenance incentive:  PhP 2,800 per canal section per maintenance period (every 45 days, maximum of 6 times in a year).
- As of July 2022, there are about 1,047,133 small farmers nationwide  in National and Communal Irrigation Systems (NIS/CIS) who benefitted from FISA, covering a total of 1.21 million hectares of irrigated lands.
  - From these figures, there are:
    - 666,156 farmers served by NIS cultivating an aggregate area of 768,336.20 hectares; and
