# National Dairy Authority

## How does NDA help address the inadequate number of dairy stocks?

- Some of the activities conducted by NDA to address concerns on the number of dairy stocks include:
  - Intensified	Breeding	and	Artificial Insemination (AI) Programs in cooperation with LGUs, the Unified National Artificial Insemination Program (UNAIP), and other dairy partners;
  - Production of semen straws from locally produced genetically superior dairy breed in partnership with the UPLB Dairy Training and Research Institute (DTRI) and the National Artificial Breeding Center (NABC). This engagement resulted in the production of more than 151,874 dairy semen straws from 2016 to 2019. A new joint project between NDA and Isabela State University (ISU) is also underway thru the National Dairy Cattle Breeding and Artificial Insemination Center (NDCBAIC); and
  - Importation of genetic materials like dairy animals and semen. From 2016 to June 2022, a total of 6,033 imported dairy animal heads and more than 76,800 semen straws have been imported.
- Efforts to expand the dairy animal population has paid-off as total national dairy animals grew by an average of 5% annually (from 56,736 heads in 2016 to 69,008 heads in 2021).


## How will NDA help the local dairy farmers increase their productivity and profitability?

- Among the key strategies identified to attain these are as follows:
  - Give farmers the options to choose and access the latest genetic technologies in the production of dairy animals;
  - Propagate good feeding practices;
  - Develop, produce, and distribute inexpensive but effective TMR (Total Mixed Ration) formulation; and
  - Make available easy-to-access dairy credit facilities at reasonable interest rates specifically designed to cater to the needs of dairy farmers to help them finance the procurement of dairy inputs.


## What is the NDA's role in RA No. 11037 (Masustansyang Pagkain para sa Batang Pilipino Act)?

- Under the National Dairy Development Act of 1995 (RA No. 7884), one of the objectives of the agency is "to enhance children's and pregnant and nursing mothers' nutritional intake through the promotion of locally produced milk and milk products”. This objective is achieved through the Milk Feeding Program (MFP).
- As mandated by the law, the milk to be utilized for the MFP shall be sourced from local dairy cooperatives and producers. The program has continuously served as the base market of the local dairy farmers.
- Since 2019, the NDA has been in partnership with the DSWD and DEPED in implementing the milk component of the Supplemental Feeding Program (SFP) and the School-Based Feeding Program (SBFP).
- From 2019 to 2021, a total of 1.7 million children have been served with locally produced milk.


## What is NDA's role in the Food Safety Act of 2013 especially in ensuring the safety of milk?

- NDA’s jurisdiction covers milk production and postharvest handling.
- The NDA enforces the Dairy Safety Regulation Standards and ensures compliance by the dairy farmers and all stakeholders involved in milk production and postharvest activities. The NDA also conducts dairy farm and plant registration as well as dairy farm audit to safeguard the adoption of quality standard protocols.
- From 2021 to June 2022, a total of 241 Dairy Farms have been audited/ inspected, while 31 Dairy Business Operators (DBOs) were given License to Operate (LTO).
- An NDA Central Laboratory also caters to NDA-assisted dairy farmers and other clients on milk testing such physicochemical tests (e.g., butterfat, protein, microbiological analysis such as coliform and E. coli count), and for animal health, such as direct microscopic somatic cell count (DMSSC), antibiotic residue testing (ART), and aflatoxin M1 detection.
