# National Food Authority (NFA)

## Why is it still necessary for NFA to construct new warehouses and postharvest facilities?

- Construction of new warehouses is necessary, as, out of the 319 NFA-owned warehouses nationwide, almost 61% or 195 units were constructed 40 years ago and are nearing their maximum useful life expectancy;
- Additional warehouse space is also needed due to the Agency’s policy on “One Warehouse, One Cereal / Grain type,” (i.e., one warehouse to serve as a food security hub and another warehouse for the storage of palay stocks in major rice producing/ procuring areas);
- Acquisition of postharvest facilities is also needed, as modern rice mills and mechanical dryers are cost-efficient to operate compared to older versions of postharvest facilities; and
- The NFA has programmed the construction and acquisition of the following warehouses and postharvest facilities for 2023 to 2024:	
  - 2023: 10 warehouses, 4 rice mills, and 17 mechanical dryers; and
  - 2024: 10 warehouses, 7 rice mills, and 29 mechanical dryers.
