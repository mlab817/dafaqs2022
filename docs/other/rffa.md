# Rice Farmers Financial Assistance (RFFA)

## What is the Rice Farmer Financial Assistance (RFFA) Program?

- Given that tariff collections from imported rice exceeded PHP 10 billion, RA 11598 of 2021 or the Cash Assistance for Filipino Farmers Act orders the distribution of the excess revenue collection to our rice farmers as a grant.
- This law also acknowledges that one major impact of the Rice Tariffication Law (RA 11203) is the decrease in the farmgate price of paddy rice (palay) and the crippling effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Eligible rice farmers are those with land holdings from 0.5 to 2.0 ha in most affected provinces, catering 33 provinces with a target of 597,404 beneficiaries. The DA issued Memorandum Order No. 30-2022 (22 April 2022) to provide details on the implementation.
- Affected rice farmers shall receive cash assistance amounting to Five Thousand Pesos (PhP 5,000.00) through the Land Bank of the Philippines and Development Bank of the Philippines. Distribution and payment modes are done through LBP Cash Cards and DBP Accredited Payout Outlets.
