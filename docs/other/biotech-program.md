# Biotechnology Program 

## What is the status of Genetically-Modified (GM) technologies that are in the regulatory pipeline (i.e., Golden Rice and Bt eggplant)?

- For Golden Rice, the biosafety permit for its commercial propagation has been issued to the DA-Philippine Rice Research Institute (DA-PhilRice) on July 2021.
- As of August 2022, initial farm-level cultivation is taking place on 40 ha. in wet cropping season as part of the expansion of seed production.The crops are now at transplanting stage and is expected to be harvested in October with an average yield of 5 tons/ha.
- For Bt Eggplant, the Biotech Program has already secured the biosafety permit for food and feed safety from the BPI in July 2021.
- This permit proves that the Bt eggplant has been found to be as safe as a conventional eggplant and can substitute for its traditional counterpart.
- As of August 2022, the Biotech Program is waiting for the FPAs issuance of the Plant-Incorporated-Protectant registration, and BPIâ€™s issuance for biosafety permit for commercial propagation.

## What are the socio-economic benefits of Bt corn?

- Corn is the third-largest crop of the Philippines in terms of area harvested next to rice and coconuts.
- With the help of the genetically modified corn, or popularly known as Bt corn, the area planted increased to about 835,000 hectares, increasing by an average  of 31.24% per year with about 460,000 families planting Bt corn for 17 years now (Alvarez et al., 2021).

## What are the major accomplishments of the Program in the last 6 years?

- In terms of Production:
  - Deployment/release or transfer of improved technologies and products to intended users or beneficiaries: mudfish fingerlings (74,000), catfish fingerlings (465,500), blue-swimming crab (487,600), drought-tolerant saba (1,537), Golden Rice (deployed in five regions), PRSV-papaya (7 farmer cooperatives in Laguna);
  - Mass propagation of Bt eggplant seedlings for future deployment; and
  - Identified improved breeding lines or varieties of eggplant, papaya, rice, and tomato
- In terms of Product development/ Regulations:
  - Developed protocols to identify the possible source of climate-resilient traits, resistance to mastitis in goats and water buffaloes;
  - Developed disease diagnostic kits and protocols for rice, abaca, goat, and poultry;
  - Developed protocols useful for DA regulatory agencies and breeders; and
  - Developed process/protocols for processing waste for value-adding
