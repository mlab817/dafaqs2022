# Digital Agriculture and National Information Network

## What is Digital Agriculture?

- Digital Agriculture is the use of digital technology to integrate agricultural production from farmer to consumer, as these can provide the industry with tools to make informed decisions and improved productivity.
- The DA has crafted the Digital Agriculture roadmap which highlights initiatives on data centralization, precision farming, and digital platforms for market-related initiatives.
- For FY 2022 to 2023, DA-ICTS formulated strategies to continue the current ICT undertakings.
- This strategic proposal is encapsulated in thematic framework dubbed as “SMART-AGRI” ( 1) Seamless interconnectivity and IOTs, 2) Mainstreaming of multi-platform technologies in Disaster Risk Reduction & Management (DRRM), Climate Change Adaptation (CCA), 3) Agribusiness links and networks, 4) Real-time access to information and apps, 5) Transparent governance 6) Alignment of ICT initiatives in DA operational processes, 7) Geo-databasing of agricultural resources and interventions, 8) Risk management of ICT resources and services, and 9) Inter-operable systems for ease of doing business.)


## What are the  priority programs in to digital agriculture?

### Updating of the Registry System for Basic Sectors in Agriculture (RSBSA) through the Farmers and Fisherfolk Registry System (FFRS)
  - This project aims to create a centralized and nationwide farmers and fisherfolk database supporting various levels of planning, decision-making, and delivery of interventions for the DA.
  - The database contains information on farmers, laborers, and fishermen and their farm parcels.

### Upscaling of the voucher management platform (VMP)/ interventions management platform (IMP)

  - The DA implemented a voucher system to fast-track the distribution of interventions to farmer and fisherfolk beneficiaries.
  - The Interventions Management Platform (IMP) was developed to address the limitations and concerns of the voucher system that will later support the voucher-based distribution of interventions.
  - Visualizations and analytics will be further enhanced to improve the decision support system (DSS) of DA management.

### Unified Comprehensive Administrative Systems (UCAS)

  - UCAS is a strategy toward a unified administrative system that aims to streamline and standardize DA’s administrative business processes.
  - This ensures the integration and interoperability of ICT-based administrative systems across DA.
  - These are some of the subsystems comprising UCAS:
    - Personnel Information Portal (PIP);
    - Electronic Personal Data Sheet (e-PDS);
    - Personnel Attendance and Leave Monitoring System (PALMS); and
    - Property Management Information System (PMIS).
    
### Farmers and Fisherfolk Enterprise Development Information System (FFEDIS)
  - The FFEDIS is an information system aimed at profiling stakeholders (producers and processors) that will enable them to strengthen their links and integrate market development support services.
  - From January 1, 2022 to June 30, 2022, from the 1,134 encoded entries, there are 459 entries for validation and 675 agri-fisheries enterprises nationwide ,including BARMM, were already registered/approved in the system.

### eKadiwa
  - Through the website https://www.ekadiwa.da.gov.ph,consumers are linked to producers and agripreneurs where they can conveniently order a wide range of fresh and affordable farm and fishery products.
  - From January to June 2022, eKadiwa has 27 vendors who served 43
  - Households, with total sales of PhP 5,864.50.
  - Coordination with AMAS for the on-boarding of kadiwa sellers and the suppliers in ADC is ongoing.

### The Price Monitoring System (Bantay Presyo Application) and Trading post commodity volume watch
  - DA has laid the groundwork for enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems.
  - These are end-to-end IT tools that help in market-matching for food producers and agripreneurs, commodity price monitoring, and supply-demand analysis.
  - There is also an ongoing enhancement of the Trading Post Commodity Volume Watch - a web-based system for capturing daily volume and prices of vegetables, fruits, and spices on all DA Trading posts.
  
## What is the National Information Network (NIN)?

- The NIN is envisioned to establish the network link from the Department level, down to the regional, provincial and municipal levels and it should be designed to interlink with other government agencies.
- The NIN was brought to action through Section 41 of RA 8435 Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act (AFMA):
  - “A National Information Network (NIN) shall be set-up from the Department of Agriculture level down to regional, provincial and municipal level; The NIN shall likewise link various research institutions for easy access to data on agriculture and fisheries research and technology”.
- A mobilization plan was formulated to ensure aggressive, deliberate, and determined implementation of the NIN.
- The NIN Mobilization Plan was conceptualized along three major implementation requirements, namely: Information Systems/Data Requirements, Connectivity Requirements, and Organizational Requirements.


## What are NIN’s accomplishments

- As of June 2022, NIN’s accomplishments are the following:
  - Formulated the NIN Mobilization Plan and incorporated the same in the DA-ISSP Year 2000-2004;
  - Approved Special Order (S.O. 205 dated March 1999) detailing the organizational strategy to operationalized NIN such as creation of Advisory Committee and Management Group, and IT units for all DA RFOs and Attached Agencies and Bureaus;
  - Conduct continuing Maintenance and Updating of the DA Wide Area Network (WAN) and 45 DA Agencies’ Local Area Network (LANs);
  - Procurement of ICT resources and services for programs/projects such as NIN Knowledge Management System (Information Repository/ Data Warehouse), Mobile Data Gathering System (MDGS), and DA Trade System, among others.
  
## What are some of the challenges encountered by NIN?

- The scope of the project as stated in the Section 41 of RA 8435 of the Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act (AFMA), is down to the LGU level which makes it challenging to implement.
- The NIN requirements for the ICT infrastructure and connectivity is too overwhelming for ICTS. If only the national broadband network is already  implemented, theoretically it will solve almost 80% of the NIN concerns.
- Failed and delayed procurement of ICT resources.
- The Bureau of Agricultural Statistics (BAS), which should serve as the central repository is no longer under DA but merged into the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA). Thus, DA is not the sole implementer of the project.
