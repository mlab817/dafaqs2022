# Sagip Saka Act Implementation


## What is the status of implementation of the Sagip Saka Act?

- The Sagip Saka Act provides for the institutionalization of the Farmers and Fisherfolk Enterprise Development Program (FFEDP) of the DA.
- The Program has three (3) main focus areas, namely: a) Inclusive Agribusiness Development; b) Entrepreneurship Capability Enhancement; and c) Enterprise Development Assistance Services.
- Since the RA 11321 remains as one of the “unfunded laws” being implemented by the Department, its programs, activities, and projects are undertaken through the regular PAPs or budget of concerned DA operating units, bureaus, and agencies, or by attribution only.
- Below are the status of some of these PAPs:
  - ACPC Loan Programs have released the following amounts from January to May 2022:
    - Under Kapital Access for Young Agripreneurs (KAYA): Php22.1 million to 71 borrowers; and
    - Under Agri-Negoyo (ANYO) Loan Program: Php636.5 million to 6,064 borrowers.
- Below are the status of some of these PAPs:
  - Training Programs:
      - As of July 2022, ATI has conducted 17 training courses and other training–related activities intended for farmers and fisherfolk enterprises (FFEs) and MSMEs, reaching a total of 397 participants;
      - Agribusiness and Marketing Assistance Divisions of DA RFOs have conducted 58 training events/ capability-building activities benefitting a total of 1,369 individual participants and 276 groups in the 1st semester of FY 2022;
  - Insurance Program. The  Philippine Crop Insurance Corporation (PCIC) has provided cover amounting to Php1,640.42 million to 27,747 farmers and fisherfolk (representing 544 FCAs) from January to June 30, 2022. A total indemnity of Php68.500 million has also been paid to 7,441 claimants representing 283 FCAs.
  - Agribusiness Development Services. The DA has extended assistance to 16,430 individuals and 240 FCAs and MSMEs related to CSO accreditation, loan facilitation, market linkage, and business registration, among others.

## What is the status of implementation of the Farmers and Fisherfolk Enterprise Development Information System (FFEDIS)?

- As of August 4, 2022, a total of 4,613 agri-fishery enterprises are already enrolled in the FFEDIS Registry System, of which 3,294 are registered and 1,319 are undergoing validation.

## Is there a separate/ special fund allocation for the PAPs to be developed/ implemented under the Sagip Saka Act?

- Unlike other laws that were enacted, the Sagip Saka Act has no particular funding provision for the PAPs being implemented (or will be carried out) by the DA, especially those related to Enterprise Development.
- However, to ensure that the law will still be supported and implemented, a particular provision in the IRR was added, to wit: “Section 6.2 The DA, including its attached agencies, bureaus, and other offices, shall include in its Annual Plan and Budget Proposal the activities and funding support for the implementation of the Program.”  
- The provision thus allowed for Enterprise Development-related PAPs to be implemented using the DA operating units’ regular budget (GAA) or the special allocation from other enacted laws (e.g., Bayanihan funds).


## Why should an agri-fishery enterprise register in the FFEDIS Registry system and how will it help the government?

- The FFEDIS can serve as the entry point of agri-fishery enterprises (AFEs) in availing the various programs and services of the DA.
- For 2023, two (2) components of the FFEDIS will be developed to include the list of programs and projects for AFEs and the roster of companies engaged in agriculture and fishery enterprises.  
  - This will provide an inventory of Enterprise Development-related PAPs of the Department. Official websites of different OUs concerned will also be linked in the FFEDIS for easy reference of the FFEDIS Users.  
  - As of August 2022, the AMAS is still in the process of consolidating these PAPs.
