- As of July 31, 2022, the RSBSA has registered a total of 5,797,974 farmers, farmworkers, fisherfolk, and agri-youth.
- Per commodity breakdown are as follows:

| Commodity         | No. of Farmers / Farm workers / Fisherfolk |
|:-----------------:|-------------------------------------------:|
| Rice/Palay        | 2,375,210

## How many fisherfolk registered in the BFAR-Fisherfolk Registry System (FishR) have been migrated to the RSBSA-Farmers and Fisherfolk Registration System (FFRS)?

- As of August 2022, no FishR records have been migrated to the RSBSA-FFRS as the DA and BFAR are still preparing the legal documents for the lawful conduct of data integration between the two databases in accordance with the Data Privacy Act of 2012.
- Both systems are also currently standardizing its information for the smooth integration after all preparatory documents have been secured.


## How many coconut farmers registered in the PCA-National Coconut Farmers Registration System (NCFRS) have been  migrated to the RSBSA-FFRS?

- A Data Sharing Agreement is already in place; however, no NCFRS records have been migrated yet to the RSBSA-FFRS as of August 2022. PCA has encountered internal database issues on their part which delayed their submission of final data sets to DA for use in the crossmatching prior to migration.

## Aside from FishR and NCRFS, what other databases have been migrated to the FFRS to maximize the registration in the RSBSA?

- The RSBSA program aims to harmonize and integrate the databases of other implementing agencies which collects stakeholdersâ€™ profile and farming and fishing activity data, such as those of the National Irrigation Administration (NIA), Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI), and the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) for Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries (ARBs), among others.

## What is needed to register all agri-fishery stakeholders?

- The RSBSA program targets to register all agri-fishery stakeholders until FY 2023. As part of the RSBSA's major components, the program also aims to measure, map, and link their farm parcels to the RSBSA record through georeferencing until FY 2024. This shall help the DA to identify agricultural lands across the country. 
- A total of Php 2.98 billion is the proposed fund for RSBSA. Currently, the program has already been funded with Php 832 million, with Bayanihan 2 as its first funding source released last November 2020. This was then followed by the release of funds from GAA 2020 until GAA 2022. 
- A projected Php 2.2 billion is still needed by the program for it to be finalized and to support its implementation of exhausting the registration of all farmers and fisherfolk, the continuous/ seasonal updating of their farm information, and the georeferencing of farm parcels.
