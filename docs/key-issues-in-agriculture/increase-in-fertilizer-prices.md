# Increase in fertilizer prices

## What are the actions undertaken to address the high cost of fertilizer?

- The FPA intensified its role on the implementation of the Balanced Fertilization Strategy (BFS) to reduce dependence of farmers on inorganic fertilizers by introducing compost fertilizer, fortified organic fertilizer, and microbial/bio-rational fertilizers in an expanded fertilizer subsidy program.
  - Moreover, the agency provides financial assistance for the procurement of fertilizer composting facilities for biodegradable wastes (CFBW) to the LGU beneficiaries through the Fortified Organic Fertilizer Development Program (FOFDP).
- FPA has also implemented the Fertilizer Watch System for strengthened monitoring and surveillance of fertilizer stock inventory and local pricing.
- In collaboration with the Fertilizer Association of the Philippines (FIAP) and the Philippine International Trading Corporation (PITC), FPA and DA are currently undertaking initiatives to secure allocations from fertilizer-producing countries under government-to-government (G2G) arrangements (possibly with Malaysia or Indonesia, as both are identified as huge exporters of cheap fertilizers).
  - The distribution will be given to the RBSBA-registered farmers through the Fertilizer Discount Voucher (FDV) program of the DA.
