# African Swine Fever

## What is the current status of African Swine Fever (ASF) in the Philippines?

- As of 25 August 2022, ASF has already affected 14 regions, 55 provinces, 725 cities and municipalities, and 3,963 barangays.
  - Active cases of ASF were recorded in the provinces of Benguet, Ifugao, Cagayan, Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Pampanga, Tarlac, Zamboanga Sibugay, Camiguin, North Cotabato, Surigao Del Sur, and Agusan Del Norte.
  - A total of 52 Provinces have enacted their Executive Order (EO) / Local Ordinance adopting the Department of Agriculture Administrative Order No. 7, Series of 2021 otherwise known as the _Bantay ASF sa Barangay Program_.
- As of August 4, 2022:
  - Two hundred three municipalities (203) were upgraded from Red (Infected) Zone to Pink (Buffer) Zone; and
  - Thirty-three (33) municipalities were upgraded from Pink (Buffer) Zone to Yellow (Surveillance) Zone.

## What is the government strategy in managing, containing, and controlling the ASF?

- 1-7-10 Protocol - used in controlling the spread of ASF in an area known to have the disease infection as supported by laboratory evidence implemented as follows:
  - Quarantine zone - an area set within 1 km radius from infected farm to contain infection by limiting animal movement and employing mandatory test and destruction of all infected animals;
  - Surveillance zone - an area set within 7 km radius intended to detect the extent of the infection thru surveillance activities, disease reporting and limit the movement of live animals, animal products and by-products movement. Every movement outside this zone needs the required documents such as veterinary health certificates and shipping permits; and
  - Control zone - an area set at 10 km radius intended to detect infection at an early stage through mandatory disease reporting. 
- Control measures done in the affected areas: suspected pigs with disease are culled, removed, buried, and disinfected.
- Disposal of the dead and sick pigs: The team, composed of the Provincial Veterinary Office and Local ASF Task Force, identify the sites, excavate, bury, and then disinfect the burying grounds.

## What is the status of the ASF Indemnification Program?

- It should be noted that Indemnification thru the DA Quick Response Fund (QRF) has already ended last June 30, 2021,[^1] and that Indemnification from July 1, 2021 to present is under the Philippine Crop Insurance Commission (PCIC).
- A total amount of PhP 1,978,239,000.00 worth of indemnification payment was distributed to 52,052 hog raisers from 401,937 hogs culled nationwide as of 13 June 2022 (refer to the table in the next slide for regional disaggregation).

## What are the alternative livelihoods for the ASF-affected farmers?

- __Implementation of sentinel protocol.__ The sentinel protocol is implemented by providing animals as sentinels, as well as feeds and biologics sufficient to grow the animals for up to 40 days. 
  - For FY 2022, the DA allocated PhP 892 million for the sentinel program. As of August 30, 2022, 15,171 heads of piglets or 28% of the 53,550 annual target have been distributed.
  - For FY 2023, total of PhP 513 million allocation has been proposed for the sentinel program to facilitate the distribution of 17,802 heads of piglets to 5,934 ASF-affected hog raisers.

- __Community-Based Swine Production Thru Clustering and Consolidation Project.__ 
  - For FY 2022, the DA allocated PhP 2.6 Billion for the implementation of this Project. As of August 30, 2022, 346 FCA-beneficiaries have been awarded the project, valued at PhP1.8 billion. Some of these are for fund transfer while others have commenced the construction of facilities. The remaining balance correspond to projects still at the pre-implementation stage, owing to ongoing CSO accreditation and completion of documentary requirements. These are targeted to be obligated before the end of the 3rd Quarter 2022.
  - For FY 2023, the NLP proposed a total of PhP2.475 billion for the Project to cover the establishment of 206 biosecure and climate-controlled swine facilities for the benefit of 206 FCA-beneficiaries. 

- __Distribution of livestock multiplier farm modules.__ The NLP allotted several alternative livestock multiplier farm modules (cattle, chicken, duck, and other small ruminants) for FY 2022 with a total allotment of PhP 178 million. 
  - As of August 30, 2022 a total of 26 modules were already transferred to 26 farmer cooperative associations (28% of the 90 modules targeted).
  - For FY 2023, the NLP proposes the continuation of LEED and INSPIRE to help ASF-affected farmers. NLP proposes PhP 188.125 million for LEED (targeting 100 modules) and PhP 4.2 billion for INSPIRE. Of the proposed budget for INSPIRE, 71.14% (or PhP 2.988 billion) shall be allocated for ASF hog raisers.


[^1]: This is based on DA Memorandum dated 14 June 2021, in which all hogs depopulated from 1 October 2020 to 30 June 2021 will be accommodated under the DA QRF, and that hog raisers are encouraged to apply for insurance of their hogs to the PCIC.
