## What are the programs, projects and activities that can be accommodated under the FY 2022 Quick Response Fund (QRF)?

- According to the Quick Response Fund Special Provision of the FY 2022 General Appropriations Act, the QRF shall serve as a standby fund to be used for
  - provision of various production inputs for crops, livestock and poultry, and fisheries;
  - repair of production, post-production, and small-scale irrigation facilities; and
  - provision of other assistance in the form of cash for culled live animals or necessary tools and supplies directly used to mitigate the effects of an ongoing disaster.
- In no case shall the QRF be used for pre-disaster activities, such as conduct of training, insurance of assets, and public information and information initiatives, or any other purpose not authorized in the GAA.

## What are the calamities funded by the FY 2022 QRF?

- Most of the Rehabilitation and Recovery projects, programs and activities of the DA were funded through the QRF.
- For FY 2022, PhP 1 billion was appropriated for the Department. By March, about 99.98% had been allocated for Typhoon Odette across eight (8) regions.
- From this, the Department requested for the replenishment of the QRF and was granted PhP 1 billion, therefore, the QRF totaled to PhP 2 billion.
- Table 2 (next slide) details the fund releases from the FY 2022 QRF as of July 31.

| CALAMITY        | REGION            | AMOUNT (₱)  | 
|:---------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------:|
| Typhoon Odette  | MIMAROPA, VI-XI & XIII | 1,045,336,855 |
| Flooding due to LPA | XII | 7,526,808

## What are the gaps and challenges encountered in funding and implementation of the rehabilitation and recovery programs, projects, and activities?

- The annual average damage and losses for agriculture and fisheries from 2007 to 2021 is ₱25.770 Billion, while the annual allocation for the QRF is at PhP 1 billion which is not sufficient to compensate for the incurred damage and losses.
- Due to the limited amount of QRF, most of the programs, projects and activities funded cover totally damaged areas only.
- Since the QRF special provision indicates that the fund can only be utilized provision of cash assistance for culled live animals, the request for cash-for-work (CFW) cannot be accommodated under QRF.
- Also, lack of funds for logistics and other program management expenses are being experienced during the implementation of rehabilitation and recovery interventions.
