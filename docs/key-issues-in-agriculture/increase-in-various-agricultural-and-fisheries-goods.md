# Increase in prices of various agricultural and fisheries goods

## What are the actions undertaken or planned to stabilize the prices of various agricultural and fisheries goods?

- The DA coordinates with the DTI on the issuance of Suggested Retail Price (SRP) on selected agricultural and fishery products;
- The Kadiwa ni Ani at Kita program is also continuously being implemented to ensure that affordable and safe agriculture and fishery products are brought closer to consumers. The Department, moreover, has intensified the conduct of the various Kadiwa modalities, such as Kadiwa Express, Kadiwa Retail Selling, Kadiwa on Wheels, Kadiwa Online, Isda on the Go, Kadiwa Diskwento Caravan, eKadiwa, and Seafood Kadiwa.

## Why do we observe fluctuations or irregular movement in onion prices?

- Harvesting season for local red and white onions in majority of the production areas such as Northern and Central Luzon occurs during the 1st to 2nd quarter of the year, while the peak of harvest is in April and May where supply is abundant, resulting to a decline in market prices.
- Since growing season is almost uniform across production sites, higher market prices are anticipated with the decrease in volumes after the peak supply season. At this point, onion stocks are being replenished with those from storages and warehouses while in preparation for the planting season (September to December).
- In order to continuously cater to demand, lean months (3rd and 4th Quarters) are augmented with imported red and white onions which are expected to be cheaper compared to local varieties.
- However, there are disruptions in the onion planting calendar brought about by typhoons and other disasters affecting production as well as irregular schedule of import arrivals. Stock withdrawals are also not properly anticipated resulting to unstable market price movement.
