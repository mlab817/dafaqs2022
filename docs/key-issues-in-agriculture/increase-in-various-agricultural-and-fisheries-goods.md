# Increase in prices of various agricultural and fisheries goods

## What are the actions undertaken or planned, or the suggested policies to address the high prices of various agricultural and fisheries goods (especially sugar and pork)?

- The Kadiwa ni Ani at Kita program is continuously being implemented to ensure that affordable and safe agriculture and fishery products are brought closer to consumers. The Department, moreover, has intensified the conduct of the various Kadiwa modalities, such as Kadiwa Express, Kadiwa Retail Selling, Kadiwa on Wheels, Kadiwa Online, Isda on the Go, Kadiwa Diskwento Caravan, eKadiwa, and Seafood Kadiwa.

## What are the actions undertaken or suggested policies to address the high prices and low supply of sugar?

- To mitigate the effects of low sugar supply in the domestic market, the government has authorized the first import program for CY 2021-2022, or the importation of 200,000 MT of refined sugar for industrial users, through Sugar Order No. 3 (series 2021-22). The issuance also served as the guidelines for this importation program.
  - The implementation of this SO is on-going and, as of August 8, 2022, a total of 170,659 MT of imported sugar has already arrived in the country.
- Aside from short-term solutions such as importation, the DA and Sugar Regulatory Administration (SRA) are also implementing the following measures to increase domestic production:
  - Soil rejuvenation through application of organic fertilizer;
  - Block/Cluster Farming Program;
  - Farm mechanization to reduce cost and address labor shortage;
  - Investments in climate-resilient and high-yielding varieties;
  - Enhanced and deliberate fertilization practices;
  - Convergence of DA agencies; and
  - Formulation of the Omnibus Guidelines for Sugar Importation.

## What are the possible measures to address the high prices of pork?
- Support the enactment of the Philippine Livestock Industry Development Act (SB 139 in the 18th Congress);
- Continue to conduct research to help develop an effective vaccine against the African Swine Fever (ASF);  
- Continue to provide support to hog raisers (e.g., access to credit facilities, training courses on alternative livelihood and/ or good agricultural practices, etc.) to enable them to live with, and recover from the adverse effects of the ASF;
- Craft a policy that will police online trading of agricultural products and strictly implement them;
- Strengthen border control to prevent entry/ spread of animal diseases;
- Closely coordinate with LGUs in strengthening regulatory functions in maintaining a healthy livestock industry; and
- National Meat Inspection Service (NMIS) to improve its accreditation system and monitoring of cold storages, and to continue its monthly submission of inventory on the supply of meat.

## What are the actions undertaken by the HVCDP to address the price increase of crop commodities?

The DA High Value Crops Development Program (HVCDP) is working closely with the LGUs through the DA RFOs to stabilize the prices in local markets through the following:
- **Food Mobilization**. The RFOs are using internal resources such as hauling trucks to help transport produce to local markets;
- **Promotion of Crop Planning/ Cropping Calendar**. Vegetable Cluster Areas are encouraged to identify the crop and the expected yield that they will be producing in a cropping season. The forecast is based on the actual area planted and the on-site validation done by Agricultural Extension Workers (AEWs) and RFOs. The information is shared with other cluster areas so that they can plan what crop to produce to avoid shortage/oversupply;
- **Expansion of Production Areas**. The Program is directing more resources to expand the production areas of commodities that have recently been contributing to higher inflation (i.e., vegetables and onion); and
- **Continuous Regular Interventions**. Gaps in areas like production support, postharvest facilities and equipment, and small-scale irrigation are being identified and addressed to ensure higher productivity, especially for commodities with upward pressure on  inflation.

## Why do we observe fluctuations or irregular movement in onion prices?

- Harvesting season for local red and white onions in majority of the production areas (such as in Northern and Central Luzon) occurs during the 1st to 2nd quarters of the year, while the peak of harvest is in April and May where supply is abundant, resulting in a decline in market prices.
- Since growing season is almost uniform across production sites, higher market prices are anticipated with the decrease in volumes after the peak supply season. At this point, onion stocks are being replenished with those from storages and warehouses while in preparation for the planting season (September to December).
- In order to continuously cater to demand, lean months (3rd and 4th quarters) are augmented with imported red and white onions which are expected to be cheaper compared to local varieties.
- However, there are disruptions in the onion planting calendar brought about by typhoons and other disasters affecting production, as well as irregular schedule of import arrivals. Stock withdrawals are also not properly anticipated resulting in unstable market price movement.

## How will the DA address the supply gap in white onions?

- The DA, through the HVCDP, has been encouraging FCAs to consider either planting or expanding areas for white onion given the steady increase of demand from institutional buyers.
  - The policy goal is to steadily increase the productivity and production volume of white onion to fulfill the requirement of institutional buyers.
- FCAs in Region XII, as well as in other regions, have expressed interest in such activities for white onion as long as there is adequate investment and assistance by the government as well as effective marketing support, to which the HVCDP and other DA OUs are committed to do so.
