# Palay Procurement and Rice Buffer Stocks

## What is the NFA’s present level of buffer stock?

- As of August 4, 2022, the NFA’s rice buffer stock is at 130,114 MT.
  - This is short by 169,886 MT vis-a-vis the mandated 300,000 MT rice buffer stock that shall be maintained at any given time.
- The 130,114 MT inventory of NFA is equivalent to at least 191 days’ supply or a total of an estimated six (6) months based on the average daily sales of 680 MT.
  - However, this inventory could only last for a period of four (4) days when based on the daily consumption requirement (DCR) of 33,586 MT.

## What is NFA’s accomplishment on palay procurement for the first semester of FY 2022?

- NFA was able to procure 145,736 MT palay or 82% of the targeted 178,703 MT for January to June 2022.
- This is still below the set target due to higher prevailing ex - farm prices offered by private traders and limited drying capacity.

## What are the strategic measures of NFA to increase its palay procurement in FY 2023?

- NFA is continuously procuring palay while also amping up its campaign to farmers to deliver their stock to the Agency through the following strategies:
  - Request for the approval by the NFA Council of the provision of Buffer Stocking Incentive (BSI) or the increase in the buying price of palay;
  - Involvement of LGUs in support to NFA’s rice subsidy program such as the Palay Assistance for Legislators and Local Government Units (PALLGU);
  - Deployment of mobile procurement in far-flung areas and non- traditional palay sources or deficit areas; and
  - Acquisition/ modernization of postharvest facilities such as mechanical dryers and rice mills.

## What is the latest update on the results of the study on NFA’s optimal level of buffer stock?

- Some results of the study were already approved and accepted by the NFA Council, such as:
  - Optimal volume at 300,000 MT on the national level at any given time; and
  - Acquisition, Maintenance and Distribution (AMD) Guidelines on the management of the NFA buffer stocks, specifically the adoption of the “6-3 Policy”[^1]  on warehouse storage.
- It should be noted that there are still remaining objectives of the study for review and finalization such as:
  - Establish a pricing mechanism for the formulation of the NFA buying price for palay and NFA selling price for rice; and
  - Identify the NFA properties and facilities to be divested or retained.

[^1] The 6-3 Policy refers to the study of NFA regarding the 6 months maximum storage of palay and 3 months critical storage of rice to maintain good quality of stocks.
