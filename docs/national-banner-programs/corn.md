# National Corn Program

## What are the available interventions of the NCP that farmers can avail?

- The priority beneficiaries of the NCP are cluster organizations. Majority of the interventions are implemented through these groups. 
- Following are some of the interventions provided by the NCP:
  - Provision of high-quality planting materials to corn and cassava farmers to increase their production;
  - Provision of inorganic fertilizers and biofertilizers to farmers in order to attain potential yield of corn and cassava varieties;
  - Provision of production and postharvest machinery and equipment, and postharvest facilities in order to increase crop yield, cropping intensity, promote area expansion, and reduce postharvest losses; and
  - Conduct of training courses and provision of other extension services to capacitate extension workers and farmers, and increase technology adoption. 

## What is the relevance of the corn and cassava industries in the economy?

- <u>Corn:</u>
  - In 2021, corn accounted for PhP 104.7 billion or 5.90% of the GVA of the Agriculture Sector.
  - White corn serves as staple for about 20% of the country’s total population (mostly in Visayas and Mindanao regions).
  - Yellow corn (which comprise almost 70% of total corn production) is mainly used as raw material for animal feed, accounting for about 50-60% of poultry and livestock mixed feeds.

- <u>Cassava:</u>
  - In 2021, cassava accounted for PhP 19.7 billion or 1.11% of the GVA of the Agriculture Sector.
  - Cassava is mainly used as food and raw material for animal/aqua feeds. This is also processed into starch, flour, alcohol, bioethanol, and other industrial products.

## What is the FY 2021 production of corn and cassava?

- <u>Corn:</u>
  - In 2021, corn production was estimated at 8.30 million MT – this is the highest production recorded for this crop.
  - The top 5 corn-producing regions are: Cagayan Valley (22.78%), Northern Mindanao (17.53%), BARMM (13.70%), SOCCSKSARGEN (13.32%), and Ilocos Region (6.88%)

- <u>Cassava:</u>

  - In 2021, cassava production was recorded at 2.56 million MT.
  - Top 5 cassava-producing regions are: BARMM (42.77%), Northern Mindanao (26.40%), Cagayan Valley (7.45%), SOCCSKSARGEN (3.56%), and Zamboanga Peninsula (3.50%)

## What are the 2021 sufficiency levels of yellow and white corn?

- In 2021, local yellow corn sufficiency relative to feeds reached 59%, while local white corn sufficiency reached 81% based on the consumption of white corn-eating provinces.
- On the average, 84% of total local yellow corn production is mainly utilized in the processing of feeds from 2010 to 2019 (PSA), with the remaining volume used for staple food and processing for syrup, starch, oil, and flour. 
- Meanwhile, 90% of local white corn production is primarily used for food, while 10% is for snack food (cornick) (DA-BAR, 2015).
