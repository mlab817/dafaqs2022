- The priority beneficiaries of the NCP are cluster organizations. Majority of the interventions are implemented through these groups.
- These are some of the regular assistance activities being provided by the NCP:
  - Provision of high-quality planting materials - to increase farmers’ production, high-quality planting materials for corn and cassava are distributed to farmers;
  - Provision of inorganic fertilizers and biofertilizers - the Program provides fertilizers to farmers to reach potential yield of corn and cassava varieties;
  - Provision of production and postharvest machinery and equipment establishment of postharvest facilities- to increase crop yield, cropping intensity, promote area expansion, and reduce postharvest losses, production and postharvest machinery and equipment and establishment of postharvest facilities are provided; and
  - Trainings and other extension services - increase technology adoption and capacitate extension workers and farmers through conduct of NCP various trainings.

## What is the relevance of the corn and cassava industries in the economy?

- For Corn:
  - In 2021, accounts for PhP 104.7 Billion or 5.90% of Gross Value Added (GVA) of the Agriculture Sector. 
  - White corn serves as staple of about 20% of the country’s total population (mostly Visayas and Mindanao regions).  
  - Yellow corn (almost 70% of total corn production) is mainly used as raw material for animal feed, accounting for about 50-60% of poultry and livestock mixed feeds.

- For Cassava:
  - In 2021, accounts for Php 19.7 billion or 1.11% of the Gross Value Added (GVA) of the Agriculture Sector.
  - Cassava is mainly used as food and raw material for animal/aqua feeds, and also processed into starch, flour, alcohol, bioethanol, and other industrial products.

## What is the FY 2021 production of Corn and Cassava?

## What is the 2021 feed sufficiency level of yellow and white corn?

- Local yellow corn production is mainly utilized in the processing of feeds at 84% (PSA 2010-2019) share, with the remaining volume for staple food and processing syrup, starch, oil and flour.
