# National Rice Program

## What are the available interventions of the NRP that the farmers can avail?

- The support provided by NRP is differentiated among individual farmers and farmer groups such as Farmer Cooperatives/Associations (FCAs), Irrigators Association (IAs), and Small Water Irrigation System Associations (SWISAs).
- Individual farmers can avail provisions of high-quality (hybrid) seeds, fertilizer discount vouchers (FDVs), seed & agri-chemical reserves, training and extension services.
- Farmer groups and associations may avail from NRP provision of production and post harvest equipment and machinery, establishment of post harvest facilities, and establishment of Small Scale Irrigation Projects (SSIPs).

## How to be included in the list of beneficiaries?

- Farmers must register under the Registry System for Basic Sectors in Agriculture (RSBSA) in their respective municipalities by submitting necessary documents. MAO/CAO shall validate their submitted documents. Once validated, MAO/CAO shall forward the forms to DA-RFOs for encoding in the NFFRS/NFFIS.
- Once encoded, farmers are officially registered and are eligible to participate in NRP programs.

## How can farmers avail fertilizer vouchers from DA?

- Currently, the DA is implementing the Fertilizer Discount Voucher Support to Rice Farmers.
- To avail of this program, farmers must be registered and encoded in the RSBSA. For farmers who have not registered yet, they can go to the Municipal or City Agriculture Office (MAO/CAO) to register.
- They should also be able to plant rice during the current season. They could either source their seed from DA or purchase it on their own. For farmers who bought their own seeds, they must coordinate with their MAO/CAO on the details of the area planted for validation of the AEW.

## What is the complementation of RCEF and NRP?

- One of the strategies for such complementation is to delineate seed distribution between NRP and RCEF provinces to avoid duplication of interventions.
- The NRP is focused on distributing high-quality seeds to 15 hybrid provinces and 24 non-RCEF provinces, while the RCEF-Seed Component distributes certified inbred seeds to 42 provinces.
