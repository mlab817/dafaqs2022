# National Rice Program

## What are the available interventions of the NRP that the farmers can avail?

- The support provided by NRP is differentiated among individual farmers and farmer groups such as Farmer Cooperatives/Associations (FCAs), Irrigators Association (IAs), and Small Water Irrigation System Associations (SWISAs):
  - **Individual farmers** can avail of high-quality (hybrid) seeds, fertilizer discount vouchers (FDVs), seeds and agri-chemical reserves, training courses, and extension services.
  - **Farmer groups and associations** may avail of production and postharvest equipment and machinery, postharvest facilities, as well as small-scale irrigation projects (SSIPs).
- In order to avail of these interventions, farmers must register in the Registry System for Basic Sectors in Agriculture (RSBSA) in their respective municipalities by submitting the necessary documents for validation by the Municipal or CIty Agriculture Office (MAO/CAO).

## How can farmers avail of fertilizer vouchers from DA?

- In order for rice farmers to avail of the Fertilizer Discount Voucher under the NRP, they must be registered and encoded in the RSBSA. For farmers who have yet to register, they can go to the Municipal or City Agriculture Office (MAO/CAO) to register.
- They should also be able to plant rice during the current season. They could either source their seed from the DA or purchase it on their own.
- For farmers who bought their own seeds, they must coordinate with their MAO/CAO on the details of the area planted for validation of the agricultural extension worker.

## What is the complementation of RCEF and NRP?

- One of the strategies for such complementation is to delineate seed distribution between NRP and RCEF provinces to avoid duplication of interventions.
 
- The NRP is focused on distributing high-quality seeds to 15 hybrid provinces and 24 non-RCEF provinces, while the RCEF-Seed Component distributes certified inbred seeds to 42 provinces.


## What is the status of the Philippine Rice Industry Roadmap?

- The PRIR is a partnership between the DA and the Asian Development Bank, led by the DA-Policy Research Service (PRS).
- The 3rd party consultant subcontracted to craft the document, Primex, has submitted the final draft of the document to DA on April 8, 2022. This will be subjected to a final consultation with concerned stakeholders for further refinement before endorsement to the DA Secretary.
