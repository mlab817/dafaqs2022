# Halal Food Industry Development Program (HFIDP)

## What are the updates on Halal Food Industry Development Program (HFIDP) activities?

As of July 2022, the HFIDP has carried out the following:
- Training courses for 590 farmers on halal standards and halal-compliant production and farming systems. To serve as starter kit, 33 cattle and 44 goats were also distributed;
- Awareness seminars on halal slaughtering practices participated in by 150 farmers and other halal practitioners;
- Assistance to 50 stakeholders engaged in halal poultry and livestock farming to be organized and consolidated. These farmers will be provided with training courses on halal standards as well as assistance in establishing their own cooperative;
- Technical assistance to 12 MSMEs in cutting the cost of halal certification for their 81 products, which will be included in the DA-assisted halal products; and
- Database development that will aid in providing baseline data for future programs and activities on market matching for halal products. This will include information on halal-certified establishments and farms, as well as halal import and export data.

## What is the participation of the Program in Halal Accreditation and Certification in the Philippines?

- Halal Certification for products, services and establishments are acquired from private Halal Certifying Bodies (HCBs) that are accredited by either the DTI Philippine Accreditation Bureau (DTI-PAB) if the products are for export, or by National Commission on Muslim Filipinos (NCMF) if it is for local distribution.
- The DA Halal Program provides technical and other related assistance to farm operators and other halal practitioners through its project, “DA-Assisted Halal Farms”.
- The Halal Program is also currently revising the implementing guidelines for the following Philippine National Standards (PNS) to guide the farmers in ensuring that their produce are halal-compliant:
  - Philippine National Standards on Halal Feeds (PNS 139);
  - Halal Agriculture and Fisheries Products (PNS 101);
  - Halal Slaughtering Practice for Ruminants (PNS 102); and
  - Halal Slaughtering Practice for Poultry (PNS 103). 
- The Program will also be developing the Halal Food Traceability System in collaboration with the other government agencies involved in food, drugs, feeds, animal nutrients, fertilizers, and pesticides.
  
## What are the strategies of the HFIDP in order for the country to be engaged in halal product exportation in the global market? 

- The PAPs proposed under the Program’s FY 2023 Tier 2 are geared towards boosting the local production of halal food, with particular emphasis in supporting halal-certified farms, slaughterhouses, and other facilities.
- HFIDP also aims to collaborate with each banner program to integrate PAPs that are focused on the production process while incorporating a separate Halal Protocol. 
  - The Protocol will soon be presented to, and adopted by the banner programs in order to come up with a list of Halal Agricultural Goods and Products ready for export to the global market.
