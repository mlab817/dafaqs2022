# National Urban and Peri-urban Agriculture Program (NUPAP)

## Does the National Urban and Peri-Urban Agriculture Program (NUPAP) have the budget to implement urban agriculture?

â€“ As a newly created Banner Program of the DA, formalized through Administrative Order No. 3, series of 2022, the budget of NUPAP shall be proposed beginning FY 2023.
- Currently, the Program is operating through the provisions of DA agencies such as the Bureau of Plant Industry, High Value Crops Development Program, Agricultural Training Institute and DA RFOs. The packet of seeds and seedlings by NUPAP was provided by UPLB-IPB and other external funding from partners.

## Why is Urban Agriculture (UA) elevated as a new banner program of the DA?

- UA has been seen as an alternative approach to address food security, especially in the midst of population growth, increasing urbanization, food price volatility, issues in logistics, limited agricultural lands, problems in climate change, and extreme calamities.
- It represents an opportunity for improving food supply, health conditions, local economy, social integration, and environmental sustainability altogether.

- One of the program strategies of NUPAP for UA implementation is collaborating with NGAs, LGUs, SUCs, the private sector, NGOs, and international bodies in coordination with RFOs and other program implementers in order to build program sustainability.
- Any entity expressing interest to engage in UA may avail of the interventions. Partners may also enter into a MOA for a UA project. Beneficiaries could come from households, the urban poor, LGUs, NGAs, Homeowners Associations/ Communities, FCAs, CSOs, business enterprises, or the private sector.
