# Farm-to-Market Road Development Program

## What is the National Network Plan and how many kilometers of FMRs in total were constructed from 2016-22?

- The implementation of FMRDP necessitates the formulation of the National Network of FMRs  to rationalize the process of identifying, submitting, and validating proposed FMRs; prioritizing FMR investment; monitoring and evaluating the impact to beneficiaries and communities; and ensuring the quality of the roads that will be constructed or rehabilitated.
- This will be used by the DA and other agencies and institutions that implement FMR projects as a guide in rationalizing and prioritizing FMRs, especially the allocation of funds through the General Appropriations Act (GAA).
- The total length of constructed FMRs from 2016 to 2022 is 3,623.19 kms. nationwide.
- Out of the 3,623.19 kms constructed FMRs, the top 3 regions are:
  - Region III - 456.29 kms
  - Region I - 353.78 kms
  - Region II- 347.58 kms
  
## What is the status of completed/constructed versus total requirement (latest data available)?

- As of 2020, the road network requirement on the barangay level is 116,765 kms. whereas the road paved is 38,608 kms. or 33% (source: Philippine Road Network based from the DPWH)

## What is the proposed total amount of FMRs for FY 2023?

- The proposed amount of FMRs for FY 2023 is  PhP13,148,500,000.00.
- Regional breakdown are as follows:

| Region    | Budget (PhP)  |
|:----------|--------------:|
| CAR       | 488,000,000.00 |
| Region I  | 1,865,100,000.00 |
| Region II | 804,500,000.00 |
| Region III | 1,114,500,000.00 |
| Region IV-A | 758,700,000.00 |

| Region XII | 417,000,000.00 |
| Region XIII| 507,000,000.00 |

## What is the justification to retain FMR construction in the DA with the implementation of the Mandanas-Garcia Ruling?

- According to the draft recommendations and review of the Public Expenditure Review study, the reasons to doubt that LGUs will in general devote adequate resources are:
  - Nature of IRA as block, unconditional grant, spent at the discretion of the local executive and council;
  - Social and general services top LGU spending, with spending on economic services (which include FMRs) trailing far behind; and
  - LGUs may likely be reluctant to prioritize FMRs due to insufficient budget transfer to cover the administrative and associated costs of FMR	projects.
- Also, it is not clear how devolving more responsibilities for FMR to the LGUs would improve its performance:
  - Some LGUs use FMR funds to spread patronage by building short road segments rather than focusing on more complete roads that would have a much bigger impact; and
  - LGUs will require significant capacity building if they are to assume more responsibilities, among other concerns.
