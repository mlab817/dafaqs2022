# Farm-to-Market Road Development Program

## What is the National Network Plan and how many kilometers of FMRs in total were constructed from 2016 to 2022?

- The implementation of FMRDP necessitates the formulation of the National Network of FMRs to rationalize the process of identifying, submitting, and validating proposed FMRs, prioritizing FMR investment, monitoring and evaluating the impact to beneficiaries and communities, and ensuring the quality of the roads that will be constructed or rehabilitated.
- This will be used by the DA and other agencies and institutions that implement FMR projects as a guide in rationalizing and prioritizing FMRs, especially the allocation of funds through the GAA. As of August 2022, the Network Plan is still being crafted.
- The total length of constructed FMRs from 2016 to 2022 is 3,623.19 kilometers nationwide. 
- Out of the 3,623.19 kms of constructed FMRs, the top 3 regions with the longest road lengths are:
  - Region III - 456.29 kms;
  - Region I - 353.78 kms; and
  - Region II- 347.58 kms.
  
## What is the status of completed/ constructed FMRs versus total requirement?

- As of 2020, the road network requirement on the barangay level is 116,765 kilometers whereas the total road paved is only 38,608 kilometers or 33% (source: Philippine Road Network based from the DPWH).

## What is the proposed total amount of FMRs for FY 2023? 
The proposed amount of FMRs for FY 2023 is  PhP 13,148,500,000.00 broken down by region below:[^1]
