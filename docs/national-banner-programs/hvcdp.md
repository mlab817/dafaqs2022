# High Value Crops Development Program (HVCDP)

## How is HVCDP addressing the challenges in the vegetables industry?

- To solve the problem in low productivity, HVCDP is upgrading the quality of inputs and planting materials, promoting balanced fertilization to retain the nutrients of the soil and to offset the high cost of inputs, and adopting advanced vegetable farming technologies. 
- On postharvest losses, HVCDP is strengthening market linkages, initiating contract-growing schemes between farmer cooperatives and private sectors, establishing trading centers and post-harvest facilities in strategic areas, and promoting value-addition.

## What are the solutions to the limited working capital and credit problem of farmers? 
- HVCDP will intensify the linkage to credit programs and assistance of the ACPC by strengthening the established Regional and Provincial Loan Facilitation Teams (LoFT) first through the updating of the Special Order on the composition of these teams.
  - LoFTs assist stakeholders, particularly the farmers and fishers, in completing loan documentary requirements to make sure that they can avail themselves of the governmentâ€™s agri-fishery credit programs.
- Once the existing Regional and Provincial LoFTs have been strengthened, Municipal/ City LoFTs are also planned to be established to encourage more financial conduits at these levels so that farmers and Farmer Cooperatives and Associations (FCAs) can have better access to credit.

## How is digital agriculture and the use of advanced technology useful to the HVCDP? 

- HVCDP is advocating the use of advanced technology and digital agriculture to establish a database management system to collect and analyze production and projection data, as well as the harmonization of these with PSA data for accurate information and reference. 
- The dissemination of SMART and Precision Agriculture Technologies, as well as weekly weather advisory and 6-month forecasts to farmers not only aid them in planning for their activities, but also serve as mechanisms that can later gauge the  impact of interventions extended by the RFOs, FCAs, and P/LGUs.

## What is the support of HVCDP to the mango industry to combat cecid fly infestation?
- **Conduct of training courses and technology demonstrations** to capacitate farmers in the adoption of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) and Insecticide Resistance Management;
- **Provision of tools and innovative equipment** to improve and modernize farm management; and
- **Provision of farm inputs as subsidy** to increase productivity and strengthen research for cecid fly control and management.

## What is the support of HVCDP to the banana industry to maintain its export advantage and in managing fusarium wilt?

- **Public Relations Campaign in Japan.** The HVCDP, in coordination with the Philippine Banana Growers and Exporters Association (PBGEA) and the DA AMAS, was able to fund the proposed public relations campaign to promote the Philippine Bananas (and its increase in retail price) in the Japanese Market. This initiative was done to continuously support and mitigate the threats of pest and diseases as well as the rising prices of production inputs. 
- **Interventions to manage fusarium wilt:**
  - **Establishment of Village-level Bio-control Laboratories (VLBL)** - Four (4) VLBLs were established in the municipalities of Asuncion, Kapalong, Sto. Thomas, and New Corella in Davao del Norte, while three (3) were established under the Davao de Oro PLGU. These laboratories can produce a total of 216,000 Trichoderma packs every month that can cater to an estimated 324 hectares or 648,000 hills of fusarium wilt-affected areas;
  - **Upgrading and Establishment of Tissue Culture Laboratories (TCLs)** and distribution of planting materials - Three (3) and five (5) TCLs will be upgraded and established, respectively, in Regions XI, CAR, X, and XIII. A total of 767,000 plantlets (good for 383 hectares) will be distributed in fusarium wilt-affected areas, whereas a total of 175,000 cardaba plantlets will be distributed (good for 290 hectares) in areas that will undergo crop shifting;
  - **Establishment of Technology Demonstration Farms** - Twenty-three (23) techno-demo sites were established to showcase Good Agricultural Practices and Integrated Disease and Pest Management Practices (IDPM);
  - **Implemented Quarantine and Mitigating Protocols** - BPI released Special Quarantine Order No. 1, series of 2019 that contains the guidelines on the transport of banana plants and planting materials from Mindanao to Luzon and Visayas Islands. The Regional Crop Protection Center (RCPC) of Davao has likewise developed a protocol for the management of fusarium wilt using Trichoderma Harzianum; and
  - **Provision of Postharvest and Processing Facility and Equipment** - The following facilities/ equipment are targeted to be established/ distributed:
    - One (1) Banana Processing Center in San Agustin, Isabela;
    - Two (2) Banana Packaging House Facilities in Guinayangan and Gumaca, Quezon; and
    - Two (2) Vacuum Fryer units in Oriental Mindoro.
