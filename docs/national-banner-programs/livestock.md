  - It should be noted that fluctuations seen in the volume of pork imports are mainly influenced by offals as it makes up a considerable portion of the shipment as a whole and its affordability makes it an excellent alternative to prime cuts.

Specifically, this is for the surveillance and monitoring of diseases (80,021 Million), Php 500 Million for laboratories equipment, LGU capacitation, development, animal disease program, and research funding and Php 60 Million for biotechnology, animal health and feed resource development.

## What are the interventions provided for farmers affected by ASF, AI and other Economically Important Diseases?

- Aside from strengthening the biosecurity, biosafety, and bio-surveillance measures, NLP, through its implementing partners in the region, continued to distribute livestock animal through various PAPs to repopulate the decreasing inventory of animals due to ASF, AI, and other EI diseases.
