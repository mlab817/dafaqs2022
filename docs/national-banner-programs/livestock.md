## What is the status of pork and chicken importation as of July 2022? 

- For pork, total volume that arrived as of July 2022 is 13,613 MT. 
  - These are composed of prime cuts such as pork bellies (56.06%),  meat processing cuts such as fats, skin, and offals (43.67%), and whole pork (0.27%).
  - It should be noted that fluctuations seen in the volume of pork imports are mainly influenced by offals as it make up a considerable portion of the shipment as a whole. Its affordability also make it an excellent alternative to prime cuts.
- For chicken, total volume that arrived for the same period is 9,44 6 MT. 
  - These are composed of  choice cuts such as chicken leg quarters (40.10%), mechanically deboned meat (MDM) (57.85%), and other chicken meat processing cuts (2.05%). 
  - The total volume of chicken import arrivals has decreased by 2.55% in comparison to the previous year (2021) due to the imposition of an embargo on poultry products.

## What are the measures/ initiatives undertaken by the Department to strengthen and improve biosecurity, biosafety, and biosurveillance?

- The National Livestock Program is currently addressing ASF, AI, and other Economically Important Diseases (EID) through the interventions laid under the Animal Health Program.
- In 2021, the program was able to distribute 3.9 million doses[^1] of biologics, drugs, and vaccines, benefitting 114 individuals and 30 farmer groups. 
- For 2023, NLP proposed to fund its programs relative to biosecurity, biosafety, and surveillance in the total amount of PhP 640 million. Broken down, this amount will be used for:
  - Surveillance and monitoring of diseases (PhP 80 million);
  - Procurement of laboratory equipment, LGU capacitation, animal disease program, and research (PhP 500 million); and
  - Biotechnology, animal health program, and feed resource development (PhP 60 million).

## What are the interventions provided for farmers affected by ASF, AI, and other Economically Important Diseases? 
- Aside from strengthening the biosecurity, biosafety, and bio-surveillance measures, the NLP, through its implementing partners in the region, continue to distribute livestock animal through various PAPs to repopulate the decreasing inventory of animals due to ASF, AI, and other EI diseases.
- As of June 30, 2022, NLP was able to distribute a total of 305,655 livestock animals funded under various programs such as:
  - Integrated National Swine Production Initiatives for Recovery and Expansion (INSPIRE) Program: 23,439 swine;
  - Philippine Native Animal Development Program (PNAD): 59,835 animals such as chickens, ducks and goat; and
  - Government Nucleus and Multiplier Farms: 222,381 animals such as native chicken and ducks.

## What are the strategies undertaken or will be undertaken to improve data collection for the inventory, monitoring, and/ or surveillance of livestock?
To ensure the improvement of data collection and data reliability, the NLP is undertaking the following activities relative to the Philippine Animal Industry Management Information System (PhilAIMIS):
- **Building and strengthening the capacity of AEWs** in data management and data cleaning through provision of training courses and workshops; and
- **System development** of four (4) PhilAIMIS components: (a) Animal Health, (b) Animal Production, (c)  Regulatory, and (d) Animal Trade and Markets. 
There are also other activities to be carried out once the System is in place and fully utilized, as follows:
- **Implementation of multi-level review and validation mechanisms** on submitted data prior to the publication of information to the public; and
- **Review/ revision of existing policies** to help streamline data collection methods.
Throughout the process, regular meetings with stakeholders will be conducted to be able to consult on issues and concerns on livestock.
