# Status of Bayanihan II Implementation

## What is the status of fund utilization under Bayanihan II?

- Under the Republic Act 11494 or the "Bayanihan to Recover as One Act", a total of PhP 24 billion was allocated to fund various projects of the DA to ensure the availability, accessibility, and affordability of essential goods and help farmers and fisherfolk recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
- Out of this allocation, PhP 23.66 billion (98.59%) has been obligated; of this amount, PhP 22.68 billion (95.84%) has been disbursed as of December 2021.

## How many projects were already completed?

- As of July 2022, out of the 54 projects funded under Bayanihan II, 28 projects were already completed and turned over to/ received by beneficiaries (see table below). In total, these projects have benefitted 3,387,531 individuals and 6,297 groups.

The remaining 26 projects are not yet completed as some experienced delays in the delivery of equipment. Two (2)[^1] projects were not implemented as the project specifications necessary for the bidding process was not approved on time by the PFDA, resulting in further delays and eventual lapsing of the fund.

[^1]: The two (2) projects that were not implemented are fish landing projects (located in Aurora and in Eastern Samar) and a fish trading center in Davao. These were not implemented as the approval of project specifications had been issued in September 2021 (beyond the June 30, 2021 deadline for obligations). 

## What are the gaps and challenges encountered in the implementation of the projects funded under Bayanihan II?

- The Bayanihan projects had a very short period of implementation; this was a major challenge in carrying out pre-implementation activities, such as the preparation of documentary requirements (especially for infrastructure projects). 
- Aside from the abrupt pace of implementation, other hindering factors encountered by projects that are still pending completion are the lack of interested suppliers during the bidding process (resulting in multiple failed biddings) and delays in the delivery of equipment.
