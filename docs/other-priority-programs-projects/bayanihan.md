# Status of Bayanihan II Implementation

## What is the fund utilization status of Bayanihan II?

- Under the Republic Act 11494 or the "Bayanihan to Recover as One Act", a total of PhP 24 billion was allocated to fund various projects of the Department of Agriculture to ensure the availability, accessibility and affordability of essential goods and help farmers and fisherfolk recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Out of this allocation, PhP 23.66 billion (98.59%) has been obligated, and from this figure, Php 22.68 billion (95.84%) has been disbursed as of December 2021.


## How many projects were already completed?

- As of July 2022, out of the 54 projects funded under Bayanihan 2, 28 projects were already completed and received by beneficiaries. Meanwhile, the remaining 26 projects are not completed as some of the activities of the projects are for completion/distribution and also some activities were not implemented due to multiple failed bidding and short period of implementation.  
- The completed projects and activities benefitted 3,387,531 individual beneficiaries and 6,297 groups.


## What are the gaps and challenges encountered in the implementation of the projects funded under Bayanihan 2?

- As of July 2022, the following is the breakdown of the projects with its reported percentage completion

Number of Projects  | % Completed       |
|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|
| 28                | 100%              |
| 10                | 90-99%            |
| 8                 | 80-89%            |
| 6                 | < 80%             |
| 2                 | Not implemented   |

- Most of the projects and activities that have not been implemented are due to multiple failed biddings and lack of suppliers causing delay and eventually reaching the lapsing of the fund.
- Other challenges encountered included the delayed delivery of equipment, and the short period of project implementation especially to infrastructure projects.
