# DA Policies for Various Agri-Fishery Concerns

## How does the DA plan to address the rising prices of fertilizers?

- In order to address this situation, the government has decided to pursue a Government to Government (G2G) fertilizer procurement undertaking. This is done through the Philippine International Trading Corporation (PITC), possibly with Malaysia or Indonesia, as both are identified as huge exporters of cheap fertilizers by the Fertilizer and Pesticide Authority (FPA).
- The distribution will be given to the RBSBA-registered farmers through the Fertilizer Discount Voucher (FDV) program of the DA.

## What are the suggested policies to address the high prices of sugar?

- The Sugar Regulatory Administration issued Sugar Order No. 3 (s.2021-22), allowing the importation of 200,000 MT of sugar aimed at stabilizing prices.
- Aside from short-term solutions such as importation, the DA and SRA are also implementing measures to increase domestic production such as:
  - Soil rejuvenation through application of organic fertilizer;
  - Block/Cluster Farming Program;
  - Farm mechanization to reduce cost and address labor shortage;
  - Investments in climate-resilient and high-yielding varieties;
  - Enhanced and deliberate fertilization practices;
  - Convergence of DA agencies; and
  - Finalize the Omnibus Guidelines for Sugar Importation.
  
## What are the possible measures to address the high prices of pork?

- Support the enactment of the Philippine Livestock Industry Development Act (SB 139 in the 18th Congress);
- Continue to conduct research to help develop an effective vaccine against the African Swine Fever (ASF);  
- Continue to provide support (e.g. training on alternative livelihood, training on good agricultural practices, access and availability of credit) to the hog raisers to enable them to live with and recover from the adverse effects of the ASF;
- Craft policy that will police online trading of agricultural products and strictly implement them;
- Strengthen border control to prevent animal diseases;
- Closely coordinate with local government units (LGUs) in strengthening regulatory functions in maintaining a healthy livestock industry; and
- National Meat Inspection Service (NMIS) to improve its accreditation system and monitoring of cold storages and to continue its submission of inventory on the supply of meat on a monthly basis.

## What are the possible measures to address illegal importation of agri-fishery products?

- The DA should strictly implement the import accreditation procedures of its regulatory agencies, improve the accreditation system and monitoring of storage facilities, and implement the Food Safety Act provisions on doing cargo inspection and clearance procedures by the DA regulatory agencies at the first port of entry prior to assessment by the Bureau of Customs. These agencies should also tighten import protocols through stricter requirements for utilization reports of imported goods, and promote digitalization of their systems.

## Why does the Philippines continue to import fish when it is an archipelagic country?

- The importation of fishery products only occurs when there is deficiency in the supply of the country’s marine resources, which consequently threatens the country’s food security and the supply of raw materials for canning and processing.
