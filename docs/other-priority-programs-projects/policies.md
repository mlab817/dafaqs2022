# DA Policies for Various Agri-Fishery Concerns

## What are the possible measures to address illegal importation of agri-fishery products?

- The DA should strictly implement the import accreditation procedures of its regulatory agencies, improve the accreditation system and monitoring of storage facilities, and implement the Food Safety Act provisions on doing cargo inspection and clearance procedures by the DA regulatory agencies at the first port of entry prior to assessment by the Bureau of Customs. 
  - These agencies should also tighten import protocols through stricter requirements for utilization reports of imported goods, and promote digitalization of their systems.

## Why does the Philippines continue to import fish when it is an archipelagic country?

- The importation of fishery products only occurs when there is deficiency in the supply of the country’s marine resources, which consequently threatens the country’s food security and the supply of raw materials for canning and processing.
