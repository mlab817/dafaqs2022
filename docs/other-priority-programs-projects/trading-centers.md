# Trading Centers

## What is the status of implementation of the trading centers funded and established by DA?
- As of July 2022, there are: 
  - Sixteen (16) operational  Agri-Pinoy Trading Centers (APTCs); 
  - Two (2) APTCs under construction; and
  - Four (4) APTCs not operational (due to disasters or lack of trading capital, among others).

## How do these operational trading centers complement with the DA’s “Kadiwa ni Ani at Kita” program?

- The trading centers complement the Kadiwa ni Ani at Kita program through market linkage activities in which farmer suppliers (farmer producers, cooperatives, and associations) transacting in the trading centers can also participate in the different Kadiwa ni Ani at Kita modalities.
- In some cases, products from trading centers are showcased whenever there are Kadiwa launching events.

## What are the issues, challenges, and ways forward towards the new normal in the implementation of Trading Centers?

- Seasonal operation of municipal/provincial-based trading centers. This is aggravated by disasters, calamities, and hazards. In the case of the livestock “oksyon” market, peak operating day is only during “market day”, which happens usually once a week;
- Lack of “buy-in” of farmers to use the facilities of the trading centers due to the traditional credit tie-up with traders or middlemen. 
  - To address this, farmer-beneficiaries of the trading centers are linked to the DA’s banner programs for access to production support services and to the credit programs of the Agricultural Credit Policy Council (ACPC) (such as the SURE-AID Program); and
- COVID-19 pandemic which resulted in intermittent operations and, in worst cases, closure of operations. 
  - FCAs covered by the trading centers who are affected thusly by the pandemic are linked with the regional and national Kadiwa ni Ani at Kita program in order to have alternative markets for their goods.
