- BSWM on the other hand, promoted Sustainable Land Management through the establishment of technology demonstration sites by applying different Soil Conservation Technologies in the watershed of the Manila Bay.
  - In order to ensure sustainability of such, LGUs undertake information and education campaigns, as well as capacity building to facilitate broader adoption of soil and water conservation (SWC) technologies for erosion control and integrate SWC activities into their regular agricultural programs.
- The Regional Agricultural and Fishery Council (RAFC) published Resolution No. 3, series of 2019 which strongly advocates Manila Bay rehabilitation through the conduct of clean up drive in the coastal areas of Region III twice a year.
