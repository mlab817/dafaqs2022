# DA 4Ks (Kabuhayan at Kaunlaran ng Kababayang Katutubo) Program


## What is the DA 4Ks Program?

- The DA 4Ks is a three-year special program following the directives of the President for an enhanced provision of assistance to Indigenous Cultural Communities/ Indigenous Peoples (ICCs/IPs) within the Ancestral Domains (ADs). Assistance include the provision of agricultural- and fisheries-related livelihood opportunities, distribution of production and postharvest machineries and equipment, and linkage with credit facilities and crop insurance to ensure sustainability of the interventions.
- The 4Ks Program also serves as the proponent of the Mindanao Inclusive Agricultural Development Project (MIADP), a proposed Foreign-Assisted Project to be financed by the World Bank for the ICCs/IPs in the Ancestral Domain in Mindanao regions only.

## What is the extent of the partnership between the DA 4Ks and the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP)?

- With the issuance of the DA-NCIP Joint Special Order No. 1, series 2020,  a National Steering Committee, National Technical Working Group, and Regional Technical Working Group (RTWG) were constituted consisting of members from the DA and the NCIP in order to carry out the PAPs that will support the agri-fisheries development of ICCs/IPs in their Ancestral Domains.
- At the Provincial Level, the Provincial Implementation Team (PIT) of NCIP carries out the collaborative implementation of the PAPs pertaining to agri-fisheries development and agribusiness undertakings within the AD of a province. 
- In this regard, the DA will seek assistance from the PLGUs thru the Office of the Provincial Agriculture in providing technical support for the implementation of the agricultural development projects.

## How does DA 4Ks extend assistance to Indigenous Persons (IPs) in Ancestral Domains (ADs)?

- To strengthen the assistance to ICCs/IPs, the DA 4Ks coordinates with the Departmentâ€™s RFOs, Banner Programs, the DA-NCIP RTWG, and PLGUs for the conduct of culture-based, culture-sensitive social preparation activities on the ground, including capacity-building activities for ICCs/IPs to ensure their active participation in the Program. 
- The ICCs/IPs are also assisted in developing or establishing Indigenous Peoples Organizations (IPOs), Indigenous Peoples Associations (IPAs), and other organizations.

## What is the status of implementation of the DA 4Ks?

- The DA 4Ks provides Packages of Interventions as subprojects consisting of agri-fishery production inputs,  post-harvest, and processing.
- As of July 2022, the Program has delivered a total of 409 subproject packages to various ICCs and IPOs, broken down as follows:
  - FY 2020: 160 subproject packages;
  - FY 2021: 197 subproject packages; and
  - FY 2022 (as of 1st Semester): 52 subproject packages. This is 36% of the annual target of 145 subproject packages to be delivered. The remaining (93 SPs) are still on-going.
