# Mindanao Concerns 

## How will support from the DA aid in the socio-economic stability of the Bangsamoro Region?

- Provision of agricultural inputs for small-scale farmers in the region will aid in generating economic activity, specifically for RSBSA-registered farmers.
- DA also targets to provide support to areas within the Kabulnan River Irrigation System such as facilities, inputs, training courses, and market/ logistics support to aid in increasing their rice production from 3 MT/ ha to up to 6 MT/ ha.

## How can agri-fishery inputs aid in community development and capacity building of decommissioned combatants?

- Decommissioned combatants are mostly engaged in small-scale agripreneurship activities; the basic agricultural practices being applied in these endeavors may lack technological advancement. 
- To help address this, they must be provided with agri-fishery inputs and machineries to assist in their respective businesses. In turn, this will kick-start capacity-building and develop a sense of community-building.
- Currently, the DA is reviewing the PAPs being implemented by MAFAR in order to avoid duplication.

## How will an overlap between the Bangsamoro Agri-Development Initiative and the OPAPP Livelihood Investment Support Program be avoided?

- The Bangsamoro Region, being a multi-faceted area populated by persons from all walks of life, faith, and cultural background, requires a multilateral approach in terms of agricultural support. 
- The **Livelihood Investment Support Program for Normalization** specifically tackles Decommissioned Combatants and their communities, while the **Bangsamoro Agri-Development Initiative** aims to provide support for the agri-fishery industry in the area that is outside of the sphere of influence of MILF Camps.
