# Mindanao Concerns 

## How will support from the Department of Agriculture aid in socio-economic stability of the Bangsamoro Region?

- Provision of agricultural inputs for small-scale farmers in the region will act as catalyst in generating economic activity, specifically for RSBSA Registered Farmers, which have already been initially provided with both Hybrid and Inbred rice seeds.
- Financial support for MAFAR will continue not only the ramping up of registration for RSBSA in the region, but also the consequent financial and/or raw agri-fishery inputs resulting from inclusion in the RSBSA.

## How can agri-fishery inputs aid in community development and capacity building of decommissioned combatants?

- Decommissioned combatants are mostly small scale agri-preneurs. They conduct basic agricultural practices, which lacks technological advancement. To efficiently provide support, we must provide agri-fishery inputs and machineries, which will kick start development of capacity building and develop a sense of community that is disparate from a lifestyle of violent extremism.

## What is the preferred methodology of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Agrarian Reform to empower farming and fishing communities?

- To empower small scale farmers into becoming self-sufficient agripreneurs, MAFAR tackles the problem of lack of capital by provision of agri-fishery inputs and dispersal of livestock and cattle.

## How will an overlap between the Bangsamoro Agri- Development Initiative and the OPAPP Livelihood Investment Support Program be avoided?

- The Bangsamoro Region, being a multi-faceted area populated by persons from all walks of life, faith, and cultural background, requires a multilateral approach in terms of Agricultural support.
- The Livelihood Investment Support Program for Normalization specifically tackles Decommissioned Combatants and their communities, while the Bangsamoro Agri-Development initiative aims to provide support for the agri-fishery industry in the area that is outside of the sphere of influence of MILF Camps.
