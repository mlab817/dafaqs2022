# DA GAD Initiatives

## What are the gender issues being addressed by the DA in its GAD initiatives?

- <u>On Client-focused GAD activities:</u>

  - Lack or limited access of women farmers/ fisherfolk/ agri-fishery workers/ Women Micro-Entrepreneurs (WMEs) to productive resources for increased production and income; and
  - Lack or limited economic opportunities for women engaged in agri-fishery activities.

- <u>On Organization-focused GAD activities:</u>

  - Limited institutional capacities in planning, implementing, monitoring and evaluation of gender responsive PAPs.

## What are the activities being funded by the GAD budget?

**GAD Mainstreaming.** This is a strategy for making women's as well as men's concerns and experiences an integral dimension of the design, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation of policies, programs, and projects so that women and men benefit equally. 
- Under this, the DA GAD Focal Point System facilitates the conduct of the following GAD Activities in the DA Central Office, RFOs, and Bureaus:
- **Client-focused GAD Activities** - provision of services to women and women groups that are available in the DA banner programs and Special Projects (foreign and locally-funded) such as:
  - Production support services (seeds, planting materials, fertilizers, organic materials, pest management inputs, domesticated animals (livestock and poultry), and others; and
  - Training courses/ capability-building and provision of IEC materials.
- **Organization-focused GAD Activities** – activities undertaken for the officials and employees in the DA to enhance their institutional capacities in the planning, implementing, and monitoring and evaluation of gender responsive PAPs such as:
  - Conduct of DA Gender Focal Point System (GFPS) capability building activities and meetings (internal and with the Philippine Commission on Women [PCW] and other agencies); and
  - Updating and maintenance of the GAD database, gender statistics, and sex-disaggregated data (SDD).
- Other DA offices are also preparing their respective GAD plans and budgets in accordance with their mandated functions (such as the credit services of the ACPC, among others).

## What is GESI and how are GESI activities being funded?

- GESI stands for Gender Equality and Social Inclusion. It is a concept that addresses unequal power relations experienced by people on the grounds of gender, wealth, ability, location, caste/ethnicity, language, and agency or a combination of these dimensions. 
- With the creation of the GESI Program in the DA, the issues of women in agriculture, including those in the vulnerable sectors, namely, Senior Citizens (SCs), Persons with Disabilities (PWDs), and Indigenous Peoples (IPs), are being addressed. They are now being considered in the planning and targeting of participants and beneficiaries of DA’s programs and projects for them to have access to services that will help them become agripreneurs and, ultimately, achieve women economic empowerment (WEE).
- The budget for GAD and PWDs is being sourced from the 5% and 1% of the DA’s total budget, respectively, according to the GAA and other related laws and regulations.
