## What are the updates on the PRDP Mainstreaming Initiative?

- Climate proofed technical planning parameters were incorporated for rural infrastructure planning and construction to minimize adverse environmental effects. Rural Roads Network Strategic Overlay (IROAD) was created and implemented as the basis for planning, budgeting & construction of the country's rural road network. Climate proofed technical planning parameters were also incorporated for rural infrastructure to minimize adverse environmental effects.
- Improvements in the investment planning were also included in the mainstreaming. The use of Provincial Commodity Investment Plans (PCIPs) as the platform for planning and budgeting technical and program support was encouraged. Value chain analysis, coupled with enhanced vulnerability and suitability analysis, were also introduced to improve capital and resource allocation.
