## What are the updates on the PRDP Mainstreaming Initiative?

- Rural Roads Network Strategic Overlay (IROAD) was created and implemented as the basis for planning, budgeting, and construction of the country's rural road network. Climate-proofed technical planning parameters were also incorporated for rural infrastructure to minimize adverse environmental effects.
- Improvements in the investment planning were also included in the mainstreaming. The use of Provincial Commodity Investment Plans (PCIPs) as the platform for planning and budgeting technical and program support was encouraged. Value chain analysis, coupled with enhanced vulnerability and suitability analysis, were also introduced to improve capital and resource allocation.

## What are the updates on the PRDP Mainstreaming Initiative? (cont’d)

- Development of enterprises is a pillar in PRDP’s mainstreaming endeavors. 
  - As such, a methodology for business planning has been formulated and duly cascaded to the DA-AMAS and RFOs for the benefit of beneficiaries, especially on marketing their products. 
  - Collaboration with the DA Farm and Fisheries Clustering and Consolidation (F2C2) Program was also done in which F2C2 regional focals were provided with capacity-building workshops so that they can assist the PRDP in promoting among proponent groups the use of the business planning methodology for their enterprises.
- Improved geo-mapping for spatial analysis was deemed equally important alongside other mentioned strategies. This will also improve monitoring and governance of the projects as well as success stories amongst beneficiaries. LGUs and the DA’s Regional Agricultural Engineering Divisions have been oriented and trained on the use of the geo-mapping app.
