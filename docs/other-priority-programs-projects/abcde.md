# Agriculture-Based Central Data Ecosystem (AbCDE) 

## How will Filipino farmers and fisherfolk benefit from the AbCDE?

- Through the establishment of an integrated and advanced Agricultural Information System, the delivery/implementation of the DAâ€™s interventions provided to farmers and fisherfolk will be more effective.  This is because the project will provide a functional and efficient central data management and repository tool that can be used as an effective instrument for decision-making and project management.

## What kind of data will be addressed by this project?

- The project will deal with both structured and unstructured data collected by the existing and operational information systems of the DA.

## Will the project be implemented nationwide?

- Although the goal is for nationwide implementation, the AbCDE will be piloted in selected DA Regional Field Offices (RFOs) and thereafter be subjected to expansion or replication to other RFOs as the project progresses.

## What are the expected foreign interventions to this project?

- Since the AbCDE is a Grant, the donor country will not only provide funding but various support, as well, such as technical assistance from Korean experts, capacity-building, technology adaptation/transfer, and provision of ICT equipment.

## What counterpart will the Government/DA provide for AbCDE?

- The DA, through its Information and Communications Technology Service (ICTS), will provide staff complement during the project implementation and facilitate the processing of tax exemption incurred in the provision of ICT equipment.
