# Rice Farmers Financial Assistance (RFFA)

## What is the Rice Farmers Financial Assistance (RFFA) Program?

- Given that tariff collections from imported rice exceed PhP 10 billion, RA 11598 of 2021, or the Cash Assistance for Filipino Farmers Act, orders the distribution of the excess revenue collection to the countryâ€™s rice farmers as a grant. 
- This law also acknowledges that one major impact of the Rice Tariffication Law is the decrease in the farmgate price of paddy rice (palay). The cash assistance to farmers is also aimed at contributing to easing the crippling effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
- Eligible rice farmers are those with land holdings from 0.5 to 2.0 hectares in most affected provinces, catering to 33 provinces with a target of 597,404 beneficiaries. The DA issued Memorandum Order No. 30-2022 (April 22, 2022) to provide details on the implementation.
- Affected rice farmers shall receive cash assistance amounting to PhP 5,000.00 through the LandBank of the Philippines (LBP) and Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP). Distribution and payment modes are done through LBP Cash Cards and DBP Accredited Payout Outlets.

## What is the status of the RFFA?

- The RFFA Program received the 10% of its fund allocation on May 6, 2022, while the remaining 45% fund was received on August 1. 2022. This delay is the reason for no cash distribution made in the 1st semester of FY 2022.
- As ordered by the President, the disbursement of RFFA release is being expedited; this is expected to be released by the end of the 3rd Quarter of FY 2022.
  - If successful, the RFFA component should be able to provide around PhP 5.3 billion to beneficiaries by the end of FY 2022.
- As of May 31, 2022, the total amount withdrawn, under the DBP stands at PhP 397 million from the total allocation of PhP 5.7 billion for FY 2022. 
- For LBP, the opening of accounts and printing of cards only started this mid-June 2022. Thus, submission of the list, creation of accounts, and printing of cards is still ongoing.
