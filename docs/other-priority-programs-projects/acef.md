- Eighty percent (80%) of the ACEF Fund is allocated to the LandBank of the Philippines (LBP) intended for credit; 
- Ten percent (10%) is intended as a grant for research and development of qualified SUCs to be managed by the DA-Bureau of Agricultural Research (DA-BAR); and
- The remaining 10% is for the DA ACEF Scholarship Program, providing educational grant-in-aid in coordination with the Commission on Higher Education (CHED). 

## Who can avail of the Credit (Loan) Assistance under ACEF?

- Eligible applicants of the loan assistance are farmers and fisherfolk associations as defined under RA 6977 (as amended) for the acquisition of machineries and equipment not exceeding PhP 5 million. 
- Individual farmers registered under the RSBSA can also apply for a loan not exceeding PhP 1 million, subject to the approval of the LandBank in compliance with their documentary documents.
