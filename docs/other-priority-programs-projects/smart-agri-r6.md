## Are the crops grown in the smart greenhouse have market potential?

- Cherry tomato is new to a lot of consumers.  But with market survey, linkaging, appropriate introduction and promotion of the product, the niche market is identified.  Other crops suitable under greenhouse production are proven to have market potential in the region.
