# Balik-Probinsiya, Bagong Pag-Asa (Bp2) Program

## What is the role of DA in the Balik-Probinsya, Bagong Pag-asa (BP2) Program?

- Under the Implementing Guidelines of EO 114, the DA has been tasked to provide BP2 beneficiaries with training on innovative, highly productive, and profitable climate-resilient food or farm production practices, and to assist them in integrating in agri-fisheries organizations, obtaining credit, linking to markets; and in achieving household food security.
- The Department has also been tasked to assist in the creation of rural industries through farm consolidation and transformation of producers’ organization into viable business enterprises, to assist in promoting rural tourism, and to assist food or farm producers in actively participating in the value chain.
- The DA, under the BP2 Program, is pursuing capacity building, household food sufficiency and livelihood development, and collective enterprise development for BP2 beneficiaries who decided to pursue agriculture/agribusiness upon going back to their respective provinces.
- With the goal of boosting countryside development, the DA is also working on establishing climate-resilient livelihoods and enterprises in the provinces to generate more opportunities.

## When does the DA enter in the provision of assistance to Balik-Probinsya beneficiaries?

- Once qualified BP2 beneficiaries are selected and scheduled to be relocated, NHA – Secretariat of the BP2 Council—shall provide the BP2 member agencies, including the DA, with the list of the qualified beneficiaries and shall work with them for the relocation activities, which is conducted in batches.
- The DA BP2 Program Office forwards the list of beneficiaries to its RFOs BP2 teams, who will then coordinate with the Regional Development Councils (RDCs) and concerned LGUs, and prepare for the provision of support to the beneficiaries.
- The NHA leads the conduct of the BP2 dispatch operation or the relocation of the beneficiaries to their provinces, in coordination with the BP2 member agencies.
- Upon the beneficiaries' arrival to the provinces, the DA RFO BP2 Teams provide the beneficiaries with initial assistance (e.g. gardening kits, seeds, seedlings). They will then conduct the profiling and assessment of beneficiaries for the subsequent provision of support and interventions to those who are interested to pursue agri/fishery businesses.
