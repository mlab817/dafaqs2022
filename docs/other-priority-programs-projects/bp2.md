# Balik-Probinsiya, Bagong Pag-Asa (Bp2) Program

## What is the role of DA in the Balik-Probinsya, Bagong Pag-asa (BP2) Program?

- Under the Implementing Guidelines of EO 114, the DA shall provide BP2 beneficiaries who decided to pursue agriculture/ agribusiness with training courses on innovative, highly productive, and profitable climate-resilient food or farm production practices, and assist them in (a) integrating with agri-fisheries organizations, (b) obtaining credit, (c) market linkage, (d) establishing climate-resilient livelihoods and enterprises; and (d) achieving household food security. 
- DA will also assist in the creation of rural industries through farm consolidation and transformation of producers’ organizations into viable business enterprises for them to be able to contribute to rural tourism. Assistance will also be provided to food or farm producers so that they can actively participate in the value chain. 

## When does the DA enter in the provision of assistance to Balik-Probinsya beneficiaries? 

- Once qualified BP2 beneficiaries are selected and scheduled to be relocated, the NHA (as the Secretariat of the BP2 Council) shall provide the BP2 member agencies (of which DA is included) with the list of qualified beneficiaries and shall work with them for the staggered relocation activities.
    - The DA BP2 Program Office forwards the list of beneficiaries to its RFO BP2 teams who will then coordinate with the Regional Development Councils (RDCs) and concerned LGUs while also preparing for the provision of support to the beneficiaries. 
- The NHA leads the conduct of the BP2 dispatch operation or the relocation of the beneficiaries to their provinces in coordination with the BP2 member agencies. 
    - Upon the beneficiaries’ arrival to the provinces, the DA RFO BP2 Teams provide the beneficiaries with initial assistance (e.g., gardening kits, seeds, and seedlings). Profiling and assessment of beneficiaries will also be conducted for the subsequent provision of support and interventions to those who expressed interest to pursue agri-fishery businesses.

## What is the latest update on the BP2 dispatch operations and on the provision of assistance and interventions by DA to the dispatched beneficiaries?

- As of July 2022, the NHA/BP2 Council was able to dispatch 293 principal BP2 beneficiaries with 601 family members. Of the dispatched beneficiaries, the DA was able to assist 196 principal beneficiaries who signified interest to venture into agriculture.
- The DA was also able to assist 2,006 Balik-Probinsya beneficiaries who traveled back to their home provinces on their own. 
- The DA BP2 Program Guidelines provide that the DA intervention shall also be made equally available and accessible to local residents in the relocation sites or immediate communities of BP2 beneficiaries. 
  - As such, assistance was also extended to 10,301 local residents or members of new or existing FCAs where the BP2 beneficiaries are integrated in.
- In total, the DA BP2 Program has so far assisted a total of 12,503 beneficiaries. 

## Will the DA continue to implement the BP2 Program under the new administration?

- The DA BP2 Program will be continued. For FY 2023, DA is proposing a PhP 500 million fund for the Program – same as that in FY 2022. 
- DA RFO BP2 Teams are still continuously validating and assessing the list of BP2 beneficiaries who went home to their provinces on their own as endorsed by the DSWD.
