# Agriculture and Fisheries Industrialization Development Program (AIDPro) 


## How can industrialization in the agri-fishery sector be hastened and facilitated, and what is the role of AIDPro in this regard? 

- Increasing economies of scale, bolstering efficiencies in the entire value chain, and promoting entrepreneurship and business development in the countryside will be the impetus for industrializing the agri-fishery sector.
- These can be attained by sustaining massive investments in agriculture and fisheries, as well as through the continuous provision of other critical interventions over a long period of time, among others. In particular, there is a need to promote and strengthen land-farmer consolidation/clustering and the establishment of agro-industrial business corridors stimulated by agri-ecozones including the business/technology incubation hubs therein.
- AIDPro’s role is to orchestrate, lead, and integrate agri-industrialization efforts in the DA through science-based, integrative/whole-of-nation interventions, as well as through public-private-community partnerships.

## How can the proposed Food Terminal System in the four (4) Quadrants of Metro Manila address food security in the metropolis? 

- Food demand in the NCR is disproportionately high compared to the rest of the country as NCR is the largest population center with more than 14 million in 2021 (or around 13% of the Philippine population) – this about 61.5 times the average population density.
- The big challenge has been to ensure food security for this 14 million NCR population considering that virtually all food staples are produced outside the metropolis, and that the country imports about 30% of its food nutrition requirements annually.
- To aid in addressing this, a Food Terminal System (FTS) in each of the NCR’s four (4) quadrants (preliminary sites in Valenzuela, Navotas, Taguig, and Pasig City) is being proposed so as to complement and enhance existing wholesale markets/hubs and other logistics infrastructures, such as warehousing and cold storage facilities, processing facilities (including for sorting and repacking), and marketing and transport services.


## Why is the expansion of the Navotas Fish Port Complex into a multi-commodity Food Terminal System/Hub the priority investment project for 2023?

- Of the initially-identified four (4) areas where a Food Terminal System can be strategically placed, the Navotas site is the most shovel-ready since it would only be an expansion of the existing facilities in the Navotas Fish Port Complex. The project will include the construction of a 3-hectare multi-commodity food hub/terminal for meat, fruits, vegetables, and grains with transport, warehousing/storage, and processing facilities/ services.
- The FTS in Navotas will also cover operations for the Kadiwa Isda or Oplan Isda.
- However, before any construction can be made in the area, the 1st semester of FY 2023 will be devoted to the preparation of a master development plan and conduct of a feasibility study for the project.
