# Strategic Agriculture and Fisheries Development Zone (SAFDZ)

## What is the purpose of the Strategic Agriculture and Fisheries Development Zone (SAFDZ)?

- SAFDZ refers to the areas within the Network of Protected Areas And Agro-industrial Development (NPAAAD) identified for production, agro-processing, and marketing activities to help develop and modernize – with the support of government – the agriculture and fisheries sectors in an environmentally and socio-culturally sound manner.
- SAFDZ will spatially account for the remaining suitable areas for agriculture, livestock, and fishery development. It also serves as spatial basis for the preservation of the remaining efficient agricultural land primarily for targeting higher and comfortable levels of self-reliance in food commodities.

## What is the status of mapping of SAFDZs?

- Under Republic Act 8435, known as the Agriculture and Fisheries Modernization Act (AFMA), the DA, through the Bureau of Soils and Water Management (BSWM), and  in coordination with the National Mapping and Resource Information Authority (NAMRIA) and the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board (HLURB), shall undertake the mapping of the network of areas for agricultural and agro-industrial development for all municipalities and cities at an appropriate scale.
- As of September 2022, the BSWM has completed all the NPAAAD and SAFDZ maps nationwide. These have been provided to relevant government offices like the DA Bureau of Agriculture and Fisheries Engineering (BAFE) and RFOs, DILG, Department of Human Settlements and Urban Development (DHSUD), NEDA, and LGUs.
