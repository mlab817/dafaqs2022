# National Convergence Initiative

## What is the NCI-SRD and how is it different from other convergence projects/ programs or initiatives of government?

- The NCI-SRD is a government strategy of the DA-DAR-DENR-DILG as the four main rural development agencies operating under its Joint Administrative Order No. 01, series of 2020.
- Convergence Initiative is a response to the fragmented delivery of rural development services towards improved governance and optimized use of resources. It shall also strengthen the LGUs to grow sustainable economies. Interventions shall focus on smallholder farmers (both agrarian reform beneficiaries or non-ARBS), small fisherfolk, upland dwellers, and indigenous peoples (IPs) using the ridge-to-reef approach as its main tool.

## How are projects proposed under the NCI-SRD?

- Projects are proposed through the Convergence Area Development Plans (CADPs) of the LGUs.
  - These are five-year development plans that outline the proposed complementation of PAPs among the DA-DAR-DENR-DILG and other partner agencies for a period of five (5) years. The interventions in the convergence areas are based on the framework of ridge-to-reef or sustainable integrated rural development (SIAD). 

## Where does NCI-SRD get funding?

- NCI-SRD as a government strategy (and not program) does not have a dedicated budget but instead utilizes existing funds of the programs of the four (4) Departments. 
  - Accomplishments, both physical and financial targets, are based on attribution.
- The NCI-SRD Bill was approved in its third and final reading at the House of Representatives in December 2020 and was transmitted to the Senate. However, the bill was not approved.

## Who are the main beneficiaries of the NCI-SRD?

- Under the DA-DAR-DENR-DILG NCI-SRD JAO No.01, series of 2020, which is currently its legal basis, the NCI-SRD has a defined constituency consisting of smallholder farmers, small fisherfolk, upland dwellers, and IPs.

## What are some of the existing successful convergence areas?

Among the felt impacts of the convergence projects are:
- Increased farm income from PhP 50,000 to PhP 104,000 per year;
- Increased agricultural production from an initial of 10 hectares to 1,690 hectares;
- Generation of 100,000 jobs; and
- Increased access to market through the completion of FMRs and construction of circumferential roads which reduced travel time.
