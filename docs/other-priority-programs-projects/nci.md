# National Convergence Initiative

## What is the NCI-SRD and how is it different from other convergence projects/programs or initiatives of government?

- The NCI-SRD is a government strategy of the DA-DAR-DENR-DILG as the four main rural development agencies operating under its Joint Administrative Order No. 01, series of 2020.
- Convergence Initiative is a response to the fragmented delivery of rural development services towards improved governance and optimized use of resources. It shall also strengthen the LGUs to grow sustainable economies. Interventions shall focus on smallholder farmers (both agrarian reform beneficiaries or non-ARBS), small fisherfolk, upland dwellers, and indigenous peoples (IPs) using the ridge-to-reef approach as its main tool.


## How are projects proposed under NCI-SRD?

- Projects are proposed through the Convergence Area Development Plans (CADPs) of the Local Government Units (LGUs).
- These are five-year development plans that outline the proposed complementation of programs/activities/projects among the DA-DAR-DENR-DILG and other partner agencies for a period of five (5) years. This interventions in the convergence areas are based on the framework of ridge-to-reef or sustainable integrated rural development (SIAD).


## Where does NCI-SRD get funding?

- NCI-SRD as a government strategy (and not program), does not have a dedicated budget but utilizes existing funds of the programs  of the four (4) Departments. Accomplishments, both physical and financial targets, are based on attribution.
- The NCI-SRD Bill has already been approved on its third and final reading at the House of Representatives on December 2020 and was transmitted to the Senate, however the bill was not approved.


## Who are the main beneficiaries of the NCI-SRD?

- Under the DA-DAR-DENR-DILG NCI-SRD JAO No.01, series of 2020, which is currently its legal basis, the NCI-SRD has a defined constituency which are the smallholder farmers, small fisherfolk, upland dwellers, and IPs.
