# Mindanao Inclusive Agriculture Development Project (MIADP)

## Why choose Mindanao as the priority area for securing World Bank Financial Assistance?

- Of the 13.98 million total hectares of Ancestral Domains (ADs) in the Philippines, Mindanao shares 50.1% or 7.01 million hectares.
- As such, Mindanao also has the highest number of tribes with 60.8% of the total population of the Indigenous Cultural Communities/ Indigenous People (ICCs/IPs) in the country.
- With its enormous potential in becoming the country’s food basket,  the vast idle lands of Mindanao can be transformed and utilized to contribute to the national food security program of the government. This is where the assistance from the World Bank can aid in catalyzing change.

## How many Ancestral Domains (ADs) are targeted in MIADP’s Implementation?

- Currently, there are 52 ADs with Certificate of Ancestral Domain Title (CADT) and Ancestral Domain Sustainable Development Plan (ADSDPP).
  - However, given the possible budget that will be allocated for the project,[^1] only 50% (or 26) of the qualified ADs will be given intervention by the end of the project.

## What is the criteria for MIADP prioritization?

- Target Indigenous Cultural Communities/Indigenous Peoples (ICCs/IPs) must meet the the following eligibility criteria:
- Ancestral Domains Sustainable Development and Protection Plan (ADSDPP) duly approved by the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP);
- Certificate of Ancestral Domain Title (CADT);
- At least one (1) IPO legally recognized by NCIP, and duly registered with an accredited government institution such as the CDA, SEC, or DOLE; and
- For those in BARMM, a Certificate of Native Title or an acceptable tenurial instrument in lieu of a CADT.
- The following Implementation Readiness Criteria will also be applied:
  - The AD is not in an area classified by the Philippine Government as an active conflict area or  Protected and Forest Areas (PFAs) per RA 11038 or Expanded National Integrated Protected Areas System (E-NIPAS);
  - The responsible LGUs provide a Resolution confirming their support for MIADP; and
  - An Ancestral Domain Agricultural Implementation Framework (ADAIF) approved by the Indigenous Peoples Structures (IPS), and endorsed by NCIP and DA to the World Bank.

## What are the strategies to be applied by MIADP to increase production and income of IPs?

- The enterprise component of MIADP will ensure that the market contracts are intact underpinning the implementation of the incubation program by instilling ownership and accountability to all members of the partner Indigenous Peoples Organizations (IPOs).
- It will support both the start-up and expansion of registered IPO enterprises to produce commodities and products based on Business Plans  and market opportunities that are consistent with Indigenous Knowledge, Systems, and Practices (IKSPs).
- The project will also adopt a ladderized approach in providing support to the IPOs in the ADs. This will involve various levels which will prepare the IPOs to shift from grant assistance by the government to a self-sustaining agribusiness enterprise through partnerships with big brother business enterprises and other financing sources.
