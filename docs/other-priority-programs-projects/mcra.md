# Mainstreaming of Climate-Resilient Agriculture

## What are the accomplishments under the Adaptation and Mitigation Initiative in Agriculture (AMIA) Program?  

- The AMIA Program has undertaken the following activities as of June 30, 2022:
Advocate for the integration or mainstreaming of climate change (CC) issues in the plans and programs of the DA and LGUs in compliance with the Climate Change Act of 2009. The Decision Support Tools created by AMIA can be used to integrate CC issues in said plans. Mainstreaming is also promoted through conduct of orientation/briefing sessions with Local Chief Executives through the DILG’s Local Government Academy, and by training key LGU personnel (including PAO, MAO, CAO and Provincial and Municipal Planning and Development Officers, DRRM Officers, Agricultural Engineers);
- Institute climate information service (CIS) as a basic function of all RFOs. All 15 RFOs have an active CIS and regularly issue 10-day Farm Weather Outlook and Advisory (FWOA) and Regional/Provincial Seasonal Climate Outlook and Advisory. Special FWOA were also issued during extreme events (such as typhoons). These advisories were disseminated thru SMS, social media, weather bulletins, and radio, among others;
- Direct farming community assistance to improve adaptive capacity for climate change. These support services include: 
  - Community-level CRA technologies;
  - Easy access to credit and affordable insurance;
  - Training courses on Climate Change Adaptation or Disaster Risk Management productivity-enhancing practices/technologies; 
  - Timely, relevant, and site-specific climate information through CIS; 
  - Computer-aided decision-making technology; and 
  - Market linkage.

To date, the AMIA has served 5,000 beneficiaries, which are set to increase as other villages are still being validated.

## What are the AMIA program’s next plans? 

- Climate Resilient Agriculture (CRA) options/ technologies/ practices should be scaled up. As such, AMIA is leveling up its interventions into AMIA Climate REsilient Agri-Fishery Technology-based Enterprises (AMIA-CREATE). These projects are being initiated through other DA Programs, i.e., the DA Balik Probinsya, Bagong Pag-asa (BP2) Program, Banner Programs, and other DA locally-funded programs, as part of the Climate Change mainstreaming in DA programs, plans and budgets.
- This is consistent with the principle that for adaptation to be effective, it must be done in a wide scale. 
- From supporting AMIA Villages, AMIA will level up to support CRA in municipalities/provinces/regions and transform CRA livelihoods and organized groups into climate-resilient business enterprises. Moreover, AMIA will mainstream marginalized farmers/ fisherfolk into climate-resilient commodity value chains by using the AMIA Village and farm clustering approaches.
- AMIA villages will serve as building blocks for consolidation and clustering and are now being transformed into AMIA-CREATE. Nine (9) regions have already established AMIA-CREATEs, as follows:

  - One of the success stories is the Caut FFS Marketing Cooperative in Tarlac – from being a producer of palay, they now supply rice to institutional buyers and are a Kadiwa ni Ani at Kita partner. 
- Impacts include increased income and productivity, strengthened institutional cooperation, creation of market for agricultural products and business opportunities, and expansion of network linkages. 
- AMIA CREATEs serve as a platform for integrating DA support services showcasing the whole-of-DA approach to increasing productivity and income.

## How effective is the AMIA Village Approach in building resiliency? 

- Below are some key findings from a nationwide quick survey conducted in June 2022 on the impact of CRA practice adoption among 1,547 AMIA farmer-beneficiaries from 106 AMIA villages:
  - Ninety-three percent (93%) (or 1,432 respondents) reported that they perceived a positive change in their life after their adoption of CRA practices; 
  - Increased income (86%) and increased yield (84%) topped the major reasons for the CRA adoption of the farmer respondents; and
  - Topmost impacts of CRA adoption is the increase of farmer’s adaptive capacity, which relates to meeting the physiological and safety needs of their household members.

## How does DA provide early warning to farming and fishing communities?  

- The preparation and dissemination of farm and fishery advisories based on climate and weather outlook is one of the critical basic services provided by all DA RFOs following the DA RFO V-developed CIS module. 
- With the dissemination of 10-day Farm Weather Outlook and Advisory (FWOA), Seasonal Climate Outlook and Advisory, and Special FWOA, farmers and fisherfolk become aware of the steps they can take given a specific weather condition as they maintain efficient farm activities and crop status. 
- By providing this service of early warning, input losses and production damage are minimized.

## What R&D initiatives will the AMIA Program be undertaking?  

- In collaboration with the Bureau of Agricultural Research (BAR) and SUCs, the following research initiatives shall be prioritized: 
- Development and application methods of measurements of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) reduction potential of various mitigation technologies in the areas of crops, livestock, fisheries and soils management; 
- Incorporation of climate traits in more varieties and strains; and 
- Development of software for precision agriculture. 
- In addition, with the support of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Developed Parties, measures for GHG emission reduction and carbon sequestration to support the conditional Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) commitment of the Philippine agriculture sector is also included among these initiatives.
