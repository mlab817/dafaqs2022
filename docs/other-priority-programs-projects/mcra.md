# Mainstreaming of Climate-Resilient Agriculture

## What are the Adaptation and Mitigation Initiative in Agriculture (AMIA) Program accomplishments?

- The AMIA Program has achieved the following accomplishments as of 30 June 2022:
  - Integrate climate change issues in plans and programs of the DA and  LGUs in compliance with the Climate Change Act of 2009;
  - Institute climate information service (CIS) as basic function of all regional field offices; and
  - Direct farming community assistance to improve adaptive capacity for climate change.
- Climate Resilient Agriculture (CRA) options/technologies/practices should be scaled up. As such, AMIA is leveling up its interventions into AMIA Climate REsilient Agri-Fishery Technology-based Enterprises (AMIA-CREATE).
- This is consistent with the principle that for adaptation to be effective, it must be done in a wide scale.
- From supporting AMIA Villages, AMIA will level up to support CRA in municipalities/provinces/regions and transform CRA livelihoods and organized groups into climate-resilient business enterprises.
- Moreover, AMIA will mainstream marginalized farmers/fisher folks into climate-resilient commodity value chains by using the AMIA Village and farm clustering approaches.
- AMIA villages will serve as building blocks for consolidation and clustering and are now being transformed into AMIA-CREATE. Nine (9) regions (i.e., Regions I [diversified cropping], II [rice-based], III [rice-based], IVA [agri-fishery processing], V [rice-based], VI [rice-based], VII [agroforestry], X [corn-based], and XI [cacao]) have already established AMIA-CREATEs.
- One of the success stories is the Caut FFS Marketing Cooperative in Tarlac, which from being a producer of palay before is now a supplier of rice to institutional buyers and a KADIWA ni ANI at KITA partner.
- Impacts include increased income and productivity, strengthened institutional cooperation, creation of market for agricultural products and business opportunities, and expansion of network linkages.
- AMIA CREATEs serve as a platform for integrating DA support services showcasing the whole-of-DA approach to increasing productivity and income.


## How effective is the AMIA Village Approach in building resiliency?

- A nationwide quick survey regarding the impact of CRA practice adoption on 1,547 AMIA farmer-beneficiaries from 106 AMIA villages conducted last June 2022 showed that 93% or 1,432 respondents reported that they perceived a positive change in their life after their adoption of CRA practices.
- Increased income (86%) and increased yield (84%) topped the major reasons for the CRA adoption of the farmer respondents. Topmost impacts of CRA adoption is the increase of farmerâ€™s adaptive capacity, which relates to meeting the physiological and safety needs of their household members.

## How does DA provide early warning to farming and fishing communities?

- The preparation and dissemination of farm and fishery advisories based on climate and weather outlook is one of the critical basic services provided by all DA RFOs following the DA RFO V-developed CIS module.
- With the dissemination of 10-day Farm Weather Outlook and Advisory (FWOA), Seasonal Climate Outlook and Advisory, and Special FWOA, farmers and fisherfolks become aware of the steps they can take given a specific weather condition as they maintain efficient farm activities and crop status.
- By providing this service of early warning, input losses and production damage are minimized.

## What are the R&D initiatives the AMIA Program will be undertaking?

- In collaboration with the Bureau of Agricultural Research and state universities and colleges, the following research initiatives shall be prioritized: (a) Development and application methods of measurements of GHG reduction potential of various mitigation technologies in the areas of crops, livestock, fisheries and soils management; (b) Incorporation of climate traits in more varieties and strains; and (c) Development of software for precision agriculture.
- In addition, with the support of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Developed Parties, measures for GHG emission reduction and carbon sequestration to support the conditional Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) commitment of the Philippine agriculture sector is also included among these initiatives.
