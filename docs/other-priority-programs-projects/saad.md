# Special Area for Agricultural Development (SAAD)

## What are the criteria for the selection of municipalities under SAAD Phase 2?

- SAAD Phase 2 shall cover municipalities based on two (2) criteria: income classification (5th and 6th) and top 1/3 poorest municipalities (less BARMM). On the beneficiary selection, these are the following criteria:
  - For group/associations: Must be registered in existing DA/BFAR or recognized registry (e.g., DOLE, CDA, and SEC). Informal groups must also be organized/ registered before declared as a beneficiary;
  - Income per selected individual member must be below the poverty threshold;
  - For individuals: To avail of livelihood assistance, they must be organized and registered as a group/association. In addition, individual members shall be profiled and submitted to the RSBSA/FishR systems; and
  - At least 2 years non-recipient of the same DA/BFAR interventions.

## What are the similarities and differences between SAAD Phases 1 and 2?

- The SAAD Program Phase 2 shall continue its main objective under Phase 1 of helping alleviate poverty in covered areas through the establishment of community-based enterprises. 
- For Phase 2, the program proposed Php 3.3 billion (PhP 1.7 billion for DA and PhP 1.6 billion for BFAR). Based on the release of DBM Recommended Budget that was adopted as NEP, the DA was allocated with PhP 1.17 billion and BFAR with PhP 586 million. 
- The main difference between the two Phases is on the prioritization of areas covered. 
- For Phase 1, it was focused on covering the 30 poorest provinces guided by the PSA 2012 and 2015 Poverty Incidence among Families and Island Equity concept. In total, Phase 1 covered 11 regions.
- For Phase 2, the program shall cover the 5th and 6th income class and top 1/3 poorest municipalities, less BARMM. These are located in 15 regions.

## Can the SAAD Phase 2 cover Phase 1 beneficiaries?

- The SAAD may cover the Phase 1 beneficiaries provided that the criteria for selection of Phase 2 beneficiaries are complied with (as stated in the two preceding FAQ slides).

## Is SAAD a project for counterinsurgency?

- SAAD helps poor farmers and fisherfolk whether they are in End Local Communist Armed Conflict (ELCAC) areas or not.  Further, SAAD has been in existence before the issuance of Executive Order No. 70, series of 2018, “Institutionalizing the Whole-of-Nation Approach in Attaining Inclusive and Sustainable Peace, creating a National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict, and Directing the Adoption of a National Peace Framework.”

## How does SAAD aid in poverty alleviation?

- SAAD helps in poverty alleviation by providing livelihood interventions that are packaged based on the identified needs of its covered beneficiaries. 
- The program also helps its beneficiaries develop into registered associations through various social preparation activities that will instill non-technical skills among farmers, such as provision of organizational development training courses and financial literacy activities.
- Lastly, farmer/fisherfolk beneficiaries provided with livelihood projects are further developed into beneficiary entrepreneurs by establishing community-based enterprises (CBEs). These CBEs shall help these beneficiaries in sustaining their production and income generation.

## What are the bases of the SAAD in measuring the project’s effects/ impacts in its coverage areas?

- **Database of Beneficiaries and Geotagging activities** – socio-economic and agri-related data are gathered during the identification of SAAD beneficiaries. These data will serve as the baseline of the program in assessing the effects of its interventions in the succeeding years.
- **Provincial Program Management Support Offices (PPMSO) monitoring** – SAAD has created PPMSOs that are stationed in the covered provinces/ municipalities. It is mostly comprised of Provincial and Area Coordinators that monitor and generate reports in relation to program implementation.
- **Compilation of SAAD Success Stories/ SAADventures** – since the program is in its 4th year, there are projects that have been identified as successful. In turn, these are documented and promoted during report submissions, presentations, and activities of the program.
- **M&E Reporting** – through the Results Based Monitoring and Evaluation Rapid Appraisal (RBMERA), the program shall continue identifying the successes, challenges of implementation, and develop responsive activities and policies in enhancing program implementation.
