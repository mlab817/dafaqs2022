# Digital Agriculture and National Information Network

## What is Digital Agriculture?

- Digital Agriculture is the use of digital technology to integrate agricultural production from farmer to consumer, as these can provide the industry with tools to make informed decisions and improved productivity. 
- The DA has crafted the Digital Agriculture roadmap which highlights initiatives on data centralization, precision farming, and digital platforms for market-related initiatives. 
- For FY 2022 to 2023, the DA Information and Communications Technology Service (ICTS) formulated the following strategies for ICT undertakings and encapsulated these under the “SMART-AGRI” thematic framework:
  - Seamless interconnectivity and Internet of Things (IOTs);
  - Mainstreaming of multi-platform technologies in Disaster Risk Reduction & Management (DRRM) and Climate Change Adaptation (CCA);
  - Agribusiness links and networks; 
  - Real-time access to information and apps;
  - Transparent governance;
  - Alignment of ICT initiatives in DA operational processes;
  - Geo-databasing of agricultural resources and interventions; 
  - Risk management of ICT resources and services; and 
  - Inter-operable systems for ease of doing business.

## What are the priority programs under Digital Agriculture?

- **Updating of the Registry System for Basic Sectors in Agriculture (RSBSA) through the Farmers and Fisherfolk Registry System (FFRS)**
  - This project aims to create a centralized and nationwide farmers and fisherfolk database supporting various levels of planning, decision-making, and delivery of interventions for the DA. 
  - The database contains information on farmers, laborers, fishermen, and their farm parcels.
- **Upscaling of the voucher management platform (VMP)/ interventions management platform (IMP)**
  - The DA implemented a voucher system to fast-track the distribution of interventions to farmer and fisherfolk beneficiaries.
  - The Interventions Management Platform (IMP) was developed to address the limitations and concerns of the voucher system that will later support the voucher-based distribution of interventions.
  - Visualizations and analytics will be further enhanced to improve the decision support system (DSS) of DA management.
- **Unified Comprehensive Administrative Systems (UCAS)**
  - UCAS is a strategy toward a unified administrative system that aims to streamline and standardize DA’s administrative business processes to ensure the integration and interoperability of ICT-based administrative systems across DA.
  - These are some of the subsystems comprising UCAS:
    - Personnel Information Portal (PIP);
    - Electronic Personal Data Sheet (e-PDS);
    - Personnel Attendance and Leave Monitoring System (PALMS); and
    - Property Management Information System (PMIS).
- **Farmers and Fisherfolk Enterprise Development Information System (FFEDIS)**
  - The FFEDIS is an information system aimed at profiling stakeholders (producers and processors) for them to strengthen their links and integration with market development support services.
  - As of August 4, 2022, a total of 4,613 agri-fishery enterprises are already enrolled in the FFEDIS Registry System, of which 3,294 are registered and 1,319 are undergoing validation.
- **eKadiwa**
  - Through the website (https://www.ekadiwa.da.gov.ph), consumers are linked to producers and agripreneurs where they can conveniently order a wide range of fresh and affordable farm and fishery products.
  - From September 2019 to July 2022, transactions made through the eKadiwa generated total sales of PhP 383,697.00.
  - ICTS and AMAS are currently working on on-boarding Kadiwa sellers and Agribusiness Development Center (ADC) suppliers.
- **The Price Monitoring System (Bantay Presyo Application) and Trading Post commodity volume watch**
  - DA has laid the groundwork for enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems.
  - These are end-to-end IT tools that will aid in market-matching for food producers and agripreneurs, commodity price monitoring, and supply-demand analysis.
  - There is also an ongoing enhancement of the Trading Post Commodity Volume Watch, which is a web-based system for capturing the daily volume and prices of vegetables, fruits, and spices in all DA Trading Posts.

## What is the National Information Network (NIN)?

- The NIN is envisioned to establish the network link from the Department level down to the regional, provincial, and municipal levels. It should also be designed to interlink with other government agencies.
- The NIN was brought into action through Section 41 of the AFMA, to wit:
  - “A National Information Network (NIN) shall be set-up from the Department of Agriculture level down to regional, provincial and municipal level; The NIN shall likewise link various research institutions for easy access to data on agriculture and fisheries research and technology”.
- A mobilization plan was formulated to ensure aggressive, deliberate, and determined implementation of the NIN.
- The NIN Mobilization Plan was conceptualized along three (3) major implementation requirements, namely: Information Systems/ Data Requirements, Connectivity Requirements, and Organizational Requirements. 
- The mobilization plan has been incorporated in the DA-ISSP Year 2000-2004.

## What are the accomplishments under the NIN?

- As of June 2022, NIN’s accomplishments are the following:
  - Conducted Maintenance and Updating of the DA-Wide Area Network (WAN) and 45 DA Agencies’ Local Area Network (LANs); and
  - Procurement of ICT resources and services for programs/projects such as the NIN Knowledge Management System (Information Repository/ Data Warehouse), Mobile Data Gathering System (MDGS), and DA Trade System, among others.

## What are some of the challenges encountered by NIN?

- The scope of the project, as stated in Section 41 of the AFMA, is down to the LGU level which makes it challenging to implement.
- The NIN requirements for the ICT infrastructure and connectivity is too overwhelming for ICTS. 
  - If the national broadband network is already implemented, theoretically it will solve almost 80% of the NIN concerns.
- Failed and delayed procurement of ICT resources.
- The Bureau of Agricultural Statistics (BAS), which should serve as the central information source and server of the NIN of the DA is no longer under Department but merged into the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA). Thus, DA is not the sole implementer of the project.
