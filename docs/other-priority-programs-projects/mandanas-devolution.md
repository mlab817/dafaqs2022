# Mandanas/Further Devolution

## What is the status of the Devolution Transition Plan (DTP) of DA?

- In compliance with EO No. 138, DA submitted its complete DTP to the DBM on November 5, 2021. The DBM then conducted initial evaluation and returned the DTP to DA on December 14, 2021 for revision.
- DA submitted the revised DTP last June 8, 2022 incorporating DBM’s initial comments.
- On July 23 2022, DBM conducted initial in-depth evaluation on the DA’s DTP. This was transmitted to DA by the DBM-Systems and Productivity Improvement Bureau (SPIB). 
  - DA is currently reviewing the comments from the DBM and gathering further inputs from various operating units.

## What are the agri-fishery functions that DA will devolve?

- DA will devolve unbundled  PAPs and functions  listed in Section 17 of RA 7160 guided by EO 138, provided also that these functions do not fall under the following criteria:
  - Functions with recent legislations;
  - Inter-jurisdictional PAPs;
  - Economies of scale; and
  - Redistributive role of the NGA.

## What are the recommendations to address the challenges in implementing full devolution?

- Capacity development for LGUs is important to ensure ability to implement PAPs effectively.
- Appropriate funding allocation by LGUs for agri-fishery PAPs within their locality.

## What will be the undertaking of various DA OUs in the Mandanas-Garcia ruling?

- For the Bureau of Agricultural Research (BAR):
  - Through a series of consultation meetings with the DA’s Steering Committee on Further Devolution, BAR’s proposed devolution plan for the R4D Sub-Program entails co-sharing of functions and resources between the DA and the LGUs.
  - The co-sharing of functions primarily focuses on R4D activities and the conduct of various training courses as a transition strategy to ensure the effective implementation of the devolved R4D functions.
- For the Philippine Fisheries Development Authority (PFDA):
  - Construction, operation, management, and ownership of municipal fish ports (MFPs) are to be devolved to the most capable LGUs (i.e., 1st to 4th class LGUs) and PFDA will only provide technical assistance to these LGUs when requested. 
  - Site identification for the construction of fish port and other postharvest facilities, regardless of district classification, will still be under the jurisdiction of PFDA.
- For DA Trading Centers:
  - The Department will continue to fund and establish trading centers in strategic locations, specifically those that will cover inter-provincial trading.
  - In preparation for the devolution, the DA will also provide technical assistance and capability building activities to the LGUs in the validation of trading center sites, preparation of the feasibility study and engineering designs and cost estimates, as well as in the preparation of operations manual.
- For the DA Renewable Energy Program for the Agriculture and Fisheries Sector (REPAFS):
  - REPAFS project implementers shall coordinate and collaborate with LGUs on their involvement in project implementation, and on the inclusion of the project itself in their respective local development plans.
  - A collaboration shall be made with the DILG for the issuance of Memorandum Circular on the mobilization and support of LGUs.
- For the DA Farm to Market Road Development Program (FMRDP):
  - According to the draft recommendations and review of the Public Expenditure Review study, there are reasons to believe that LGUs will, in general, be unable to devote adequate resources because of the following:
    - Nature of IRA as block, unconditional grant, spent at the discretion of the local executive and council;
    - Social and general services top LGU spending, with spending on economic services (which include FMRs) trailing far behind; and
    - LGUs may likely be reluctant to prioritize FMRs due to insufficient budget transfer to cover the administrative and associated costs of FMR	projects.
  - Also, it is not clear how devolving more responsibilities for FMR to the LGUs would improve its performance, given that:
    - Some LGUs use FMR funds to spread patronage by building short road segments rather than focusing on more complete roads that would have a much bigger impact; and 
    - LGUs will require significant capacity building if they are to assume more responsibilities, among other concerns.
- For the National Irrigation Administration (NIA):
  - In lieu of the devolution of communal irrigation systems, the National Irrigation Master Plan (NIMP) 2020 – 2030 sets a total of 353,111 hectares that will be implemented by NIA, while an estimated 328,598 hectares will be implemented by Other Government Agencies (OGA) and LGUs.
  - Under the NIMP, the estimated investment requirement for 2020-2030 amounting to PhP 561 billion will be distributed as follows:
    - NIA: PhP 337 billion;
    - LGU: PhP 195 billion; and
    - OGA: PhP 29 billion
