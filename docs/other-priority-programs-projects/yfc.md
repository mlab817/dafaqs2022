# Young Farmers Challenge Fund (YFC) 

## What are the results of the 2021 Young Farmers Challenge program?

- A total of 1,276 youth benefited from the 2021 YFC program, having received financial grant as start-up capital for their proposed agribusiness venture.  
- Eight hundred eighteen (818) start-up enterprises were established by these YFC beneficiaries.  About 73% (or 601 enterprises) are engaged in production, 11% (or 90 enterprises) are into processing, and the remaining 16% (or 127 enterprises) are vertically-integrated enterprises or those enterprises engaged in both production and processing, and/or marketing.
- As of August 2022, about 90% of the enterprises (or 737) are currently operating their agribusiness ventures, 4.6% (38 enterprises) are experiencing delays in their implementation but will continue to implement, and about 4.9% (40 enterprises) have stopped their enterprise implementation.  
- Continuous coordination is being done to encourage these youths to pursue their agribusiness ventures.

## What are the means to ensure that the YFC awardees will continue their engagement in agriculture?

- The provision of financial grants is only the first step to entice the youth to engage in agriculture. Enterprise assessment and close monitoring are being done to determine the appropriate capacity development plan for each of their enterprises.  
- A series of different business development assistance is also being provided by the DA to these awardees, such as training and mentoring assistance, among others.  The participation of these youth to the YFC has also made it easier for them to be linked with the different programs and projects of the Department.
- Similarly, the YFC beneficiaries were assisted in forming and registering the Young Farmers Challenge Club of the Philippines, Inc. (YFCI) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  The primary objective of the club is to serve as a community platform to further promote agriculture and help the youth engage in agribusiness.

## How does the program intend to continue in the coming years?

- The DA envisions the YFC to become a regular program that will continuously provide financial grants to those youth who have the passion and grit to start their dream agribusiness.
- The DA Agribusiness and Marketing Assistance Service (AMAS) will continue its partnership with the Agricultural Training Institute (ATI) for the provision of trainings courses, the SUCs as incubators of technical know-how of young farmers, the Embassy of China for the provision short course trainings on the best agricultural practices, as well as with other NGAs such as DTI, FDA, and CDA, and the private sector (such as QBO innovation hub and VSO Philippines), among others.
- Also, the DA supports the ratification and institutionalization of the Senate Bill No. 884 otherwise known as “An Act Launching the Young Farmers Challenge Programs, Planning and Evaluating the programs of the DA, DTI, DAR, NYC and LGUs” which intends to address the myriad problems of the youth such as access to market, access to land, and engagement to policy dialogues.
